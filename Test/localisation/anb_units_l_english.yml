 cannorian_1_medieval_infantry:0 "Medieval Infantry"
 cannorian_1_medieval_infantryDESCR:0 "The basic soldier of Cannorian armies. They tended to be peasant levies with little or no training and very poor equipment. However when deployed en masse they could be devastating.."
 cannorian_1_medieval_knights:0 "Medieval Knights"
 cannorian_1_medieval_knightsDESCR:0 "The medieval Knight originated with the Castanorian hero Caylen Longlance's reforms, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Cannor and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 cannorian_5_longbow:0 "Damerian Longbowmen"
 cannorian_5_longbowDESCR:0 "Despite the elven stereotype of being master-archers, it was actually their long-term allies, the Damerians, that taught them the art of the bow. Up until the end of the Lilac Wars, the longbow was the Damerian weapon-of-choice, and were the bane of many a Lorentish knight."
 cannorian_5_men_at_arms:0 "Men-at-Arms"
 cannorian_5_men_at_armsDESCR:0 "The Man-at-Arms was a professional soldier in Cannorian armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier, often bearing steel from the many foundries and workshops that rose during the time, such as the dwarves of Silverforge and the Vanburies of Telgeir. During the Lilac Wars, Men-at-Arms were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants-at-Arms."
 cannorian_9_adventurer_band:0 "Adventurer Bands"
 cannorian_9_adventurer_bandDESCR:0 "Adventurers have been both a boon and a bane across Cannor for years. Often troublesome, but also offering a wide breadth of experience and insight beyond the common soldier - by integrating adventurers within our armies it allows us to cover a wide breadth of situations and draw upon their expertise."
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shot:0 "Pike & Shot"
 cannorian_9_pike_and_shotDESCR:0 "It is said that the Pike & Shot helped win the Greentide - and that the thunderous roar of gunfire caused even the bravest of orcish hordes to hesitate. Earlier variants had heavily armoured pikemen and halberdiers supported by embedded arquebusiers in order to both strike fear and gun down orcs and be able to face them in close combat. After the Greentide the armoured pikemen portion slowly fell out of favour to lighter cuirasses or no heavy armour at all."
 cannorian_10_gun_knights:0 "Gun Knights"
 cannorian_10_gun_knightsDESCR:0 "With the advent of smaller firearms by gnomish inventors, knights and other heavy cavalrymen often carried several pistols with them in battle to discharge at close range during their charges."
 cannorian_12_thorn_formation:0 "Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_12_thorn_formationDESCR:0 "The Thorn Formation was a mixed infantry formation of pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Originally developed by the Lorentish general Darien síl Ainethán during its Wars of Dominion against Gawed it proved that a smaller, defensive and elite Lorentish force could defeat the larger mass of Gawedi infantry (who at that time were still primarily using melee weapons)."
 cannorian_14_outriders:0 "Outriders"
 cannorian_14_outridersDESCR:0 "As guns became more easily mass-produced the role of the knight in mounted combat diminished. No longer did cavalry need specialized training, money or noble-birth, but instead simply be able to charge, swing and shoot."
 cannorian_15_volley_infantry:0 "Volley Infantry"
 cannorian_15_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Halfling War of Independence the halfling armies were outmatched by the pike/musket combination of the Lorentish Thorn Formations. As halflings could not wield pikes due to their stature, they developed a new tactic relying on mass fire with lines twelve, six or eight musketeers deep. When the first ranked line fired, they would run move to the rear and the second line would fire. Due to the availability of muskets and more importantly, the large populations of halflings, this system negated the long reload relating to muskets, and stood well against the more defensive and stationary Thorn Formation."
 cannorian_18_reformed_outriders:0 "Reformed Outriders"
 cannorian_18_reformed_outridersDESCR:0 "The advent of more reliable and accurate guns reformed the army as a whole, moving to a lighter armoured infantry core that wielded rifles as their primary weapon. In return heavy armour was no longer prized in battle, as the usual bullet could penetrate it, and outriders soon abandoned heavier plate to just a simple breastplate."
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2:0 "Ashen Thorn Formation"
 cannorian_19_thorn_formation2DESCR:0 "Over time bullets became deadlier and armour became more and more obsolete. As armies changed to lighter cavalry and less-armoured infantry, the famous Thorn Formation replaced a large majority of their pikemen with more musketeers, hence the 'ash'."
 cannorian_23_dragoons:0 "Escanni Dragoons"
 cannorian_23_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In 17th century Escann, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried, a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon (named after the core sigil of Escann). Dragoons were widely used by all Cannorian nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 cannorian_23_line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 cannorian_23_line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."
 cannorian_26_carabiners:0 "Carabiners"
 cannorian_26_carabinersDESCR:0 "The Carabiners first came into being in the 16th century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armor, though slightly less than a Cuirassier. The main difference between them was their armament. Carabiners main weapon was the carabine, sometimes also called the arquebus, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carabine, they were also armed with pistols and a sword."
 cannorian_26_rosecoat_infantry:0 "Rosecoat Infantry"

 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantry:0 "Dovecoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dovecoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Due to the high population of Anbennar, Dovecoat infantry focused on simply taking volleys and overwhelming the enemy with numbers."
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantry:0 "Dragoncoat Infantry"
 cannorian_26_dragoncoat_infantryDESCR:0 "Dragoncoat infantry rely on being able to take damage and deal it back tenfold, similar to how a dragon's scale can withstand damage and a dragon's breathe can cause it."
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantry:0 "Impulse Infantry"
 cannorian_28_impulse_infantryDESCR:0 "During the Wars of the Northern League, the main Gawedi army was outmatched and faltering. To make up for this, irregular units from the frontier, such as hunters from the Greatwoods, were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Gawedi armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the Cannorian battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."
 cannorian_28_cuirassier:0 "Cuirassier"
 cannorian_28_cuirassierDESCR:0 "The Cuirassier takes its name from the Cuirass, a breast plate worn by the heaviest cavalry units. Wielding a heavy sword rather than a light saber, these units are fearsome when they charge. Usually supported by units of carbine equipped cavalry to give them extra punch, these units add shock power to any army."
 cannorian_30_drill_infantry:0 "Ancardian Drill Infantry"
 cannorian_30_drill_infantryDESCR:0 "The Ancardian Reforms revolutionized early modern warfare, instilling the reliance of simple yet effective drills to not only maximize firepower output but a reinforced and near-unbreakable line."
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregulars:0 "Sparkdrive Irregulars"
 cannorian_30_sparkdrive_irregularsDESCR:0 "The Sparkdrive Rifle was a strange gnomish invention that was said to contain an essence of a lightning elemental, operated by a rotating lever that charged the rifle and shot a burst of concentrated lightning. Eventually these Sparkdrive companies, also known as 'Cranker Companies' after the sound of the lever, were a prized part of warfare, often used to snipe enemy commanders in the battlefield, and even targetting armies as they camped."

 dwarven_5_pepperers:0 "Pepperers"
 dwarven_5_pepperersDESCR:0 "Dwarven military tactics always favour the conservation of dwarven life rather than the conservation of resources, and any foe who faces the dwarven clans is liable to be peppered with never-ending hails of crossbow bolts."
 dwarven_5_phalanx:0 "Shield Phalanx"
 dwarven_5_phalanxDESCR:0 "Interlocking shields and long pikes paired with the dwarven short stature ensures that the dwarven phalanx is unbreakable against most armies."
 dwarven_6_ram_cavalry:0 "Ram Cavalry"
 dwarven_6_ram_cavalryDESCR:0 "Cavalry has never been a core contingent of dwarven armies due to their short stature and defensive orientation. In cases where an enemy army refuses to be broken the dwarven offensive is led by a shattering charge of warbred rams, often guaranteeing an enemy rout."
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_phalanx:0 "Pepper & Phalanx"
 dwarven_9_pepper_and_phalanxDESCR:0 "By replacing the shield with heavier armour, the phalanx can now integrate dwarven pepperers within their ranks, negating the weakness of exposed ranged combatants."
 dwarven_9_heavy_axemen:0 "Heavy Axemen"
 dwarven_9_heavy_axemenDESCR:0 "As new advances in the field of armour were made, it allowed dwarves to rely on their own plate than the safety of the shieldwall. Many forsook the defensive phalanx and bore large waraxes that can be used to quickly fell taller opponents with blows to the legs. Foes of a more equal stature will find the dwarven waraxe equally well-suited to decapitation."
 dwarven_10_ram_rangers:0 "Ram Rangers"
 dwarven_10_ram_rangersDESCR:0 "Ram Rangers serve both as shock heavy cavalry in addition to their most important role as scouts and guides. It is a common sight to see Ram Rangers perched on mountain walls and cliffs in impossible angles, a clear sign of an advancing dwarven army."
 dwarven_12_gun_and_tortoise:0 "Gun & Tortoise"
 dwarven_12_gun_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "The Tortoise Formation was an ancient variant of the shieldwall used in the Final Days of Dwarovar when much of the fighting were in the wide roads and plazas of the holds that made the dwarven armies susceptible to missile fire. By integrating guns within the shield-led tortoise formation we can create a moving gun platform that can withstand any swarm of enemy."
 dwarven_12_berserkers:0 "Berserkers"
 dwarven_12_berserkersDESCR:0 "Known for their rage, berserkers are the antithesis of standard dwarven military tradition, and were often used as irregulars to shatter enemy flanks. It was said that the fury of a dwarven berserker could match and surpass those of their orcish equivalent."
 dwarven_15_war_wagons:0 "War Wagons"
 dwarven_15_war_wagonsDESCR:0 "The traditional war wagon is an armored cart drawn by rams.

 dwarven_26_engineers:0 "Engineers"
 dwarven_26_engineersDESCR:0 "As dwarven militaries made use of increasingly sophisticated battlefield machinery, the traditional image of a fearsome dwarven warrior was often replaced by battle-hardened engineers who could use and maintain machinery and, in a pinch, fight in formation."
 dwarven_26_rangers:0 "Rangers"
 dwarven_26_rangersDESCR:0 "Advancements in firearm technology allowed later dwarven militaries to incorporate groups of ranger auxiliaries who could operate separately from the main force and engage the enemy from a distance."

 dwarven_28_reformed_gun_and_tortoiseDESCR:0 "The advent of battlefield machinery made the tortoise formation obsolete, as artillery and machine weapons could easily disrupt sections of any large, slow formation from afar.

 dwarven_28_mecharams:0 "Mecha-Ram Cavalry"

 dwarven_28_grenadiersDESCR:0 "A dwarven invention, grenades are often thrown at great distances against a charging foe.

 eordand_1_court_knightsDESCR:0 "The traditional offensive backbone of Eordandi armies is the knight, charging into and scattering the enemy infantry. Typically made up of the warrior nobility of their nation, they are completely devoted to their respective Season or Eordellon, and will lay down their lives to defend it."
 eordand_1_ruin_garrison:0 "Ruin Garrison"
 eordand_1_ruin_garrisonDESCR:0 "With the constant wars that have plagued Eordand since the failure of Pelomar to reassert the fey’s authority, fortifications around Precursor ruins have become an integral part of the landscape. The armies of the different states are typically formed out of soldiers who spend most of their time defending these fortifications, only leaving during wartime. This defensive experience led to battles to be dominated by  stagnant lines of infantry taunting each other while waiting for the enemy to be broken by a cavalry charge or a well-placed fireball."
 eordand_5_circle_vanguard:0 "Circle Vanguard"
 eordand_5_circle_vanguardDESCR:0 "The continued warring between the seasons led to a new innovation infantry development- shock tactics. No longer would infantry be content to taunt and jeer at each other, but would now begin the battle by charging into combat."

 eordand_9_tuathak_legionDESCR:0 "The Tuathak saw victory over the hated Winter-worshipping Snecboth by maintaining well-disciplined units and chains of command.

 eordand_10_eordan_paladins:0 "Eordan Paladins"
 eordand_10_eordan_paladinsDESCR:0 "With the intensification of religious wars across Eordand, traditional noble warriors began to be replaced by specialised religious crusaders. The clergy of the seasonal courts have always distrusted the nobility, and replaced the secular knights with paladins devoted to them. These fighters spent their entire lives training, and as such were much more effective than their ruling counterparts."
 eordand_12_jhorgashirr_square:0 "Jhorgashirran Square"
 eordand_12_jhorgashirr_squareDESCR:0 "As infantry tactics continued to improve, Jhorgashirr remained at the forefront of developments.

 eordand_14_arakepruni_caracole:0 "Arakepruni Caracole"
 eordand_14_arakepruni_caracoleDESCR:0 "With the introduction of gunpowder into the conflicts of the seasons, the traditional cavalry fighters of the Spring Court were forced to adapt. The open plains of the Darhan had always been a land of pastures and were well suited for the mobility of cavalry. They began to adopt a system of cycling through pistol-armed horsemen, pounding the enemy with a barrage of highly mobile firepower whilst being out of range or too mobile for retaliation."

 eordand_15_peitar_gladeguardsDESCR:0 "The true followers of the Fey were initially hurt by the arrival of the Cannorians, with them having little connection to the sea to trade with them.

 eordand_18_snecboth_skirmishersDESCR:0 "As the size of armies continued to increase in the 17th century, the Winter Court was unable to keep pace with its more populous rivals. To remedy this, they improved upon the old tradition of highly mobile horsemen to scout and harass the enemy, reducing their numerical advantage before the battle was even joined. Professional scouts were trained to make sure they were ever ready to harass the enemy."

 eordand_26_four_courts_infantryDESCR:0 "With the intrusion of organized colonial states into Eordand, a new unity was forged among the four courts and the Eordellon. With all of the positive traits of the Fey and the seasons combined, their followers were stronger than ever before."

 harimari_1_harimari_chargers:0 "Harimari Chargers"
 harimari_1_harimari_chargersDESCR:0 "There was little reason for early Harimari armies to make use of mounted cavalry, as the Harimari race retained the ability to sprint quadrupedally even as they evolved to stand upright. Rather than a traditional mounted regiment, a segment of the force was comprised of designated Chargers, who would attack enemy flanks with all the raw predatory prowess of a tiger."

 harimari_9_harimraj_infantryDESCR:0 "The Harimraj brought with it a new class of full time professional soldiers. The Harimraj infantry prized skill, artisanship, and high culture. This was a point of pride, a piece of evidence that the Harimari were more sophisticated than, and thus superior to, other races."
 harimari_10_elephant_riders:0 "Elephant Riders"
 harimari_10_elephant_ridersDESCR:0 "Most mounts were unsuited to the Harimari's great size, and many herd animals are instinctually afraid of them due to their tiger-like appearance.

 harimari_12_reformed_harimraj_infantryDESCR:0 "The ancient Harimraj infantry was highly selective, but this proved to be its downfall when it could not sustain the numbers necessary to defend Harimar's empire. By allowing supplementary human levies to partially participate in the culture of the Harimari infantry itself, later armies bolstered their numbers while retaining their quality and sophistication."

 harimari_18_harimari_musketeersDESCR:0 "When firearms began to dominate the battlefield, the Harimari dedication to excellence led to the development of institutions dedicated to the art of sharpshooting. The very finest sharpshooters were informally given the name 'Triggerclaws', and they made up the elite core of any Harimari musket regiment."
 harimari_23_harimraj_musketeers:0 "Reformed Triggerclaws"
 harimari_23_harimraj_musketeersDESCR:0 "New infantry formations with multiple lines of musketeers were created. These formations took care to ensure that sharpshooters would be reserved until later in the battle, when the lower density of enemy forces reduced the probability of a successful shot. This had the side-effect of making a soldier much less likely to die, and so many more aspired to become Triggerclaws themselves."
 harimari_23_raheni_dragoons:0 "Raheni Dragoons"
 harimari_23_raheni_dragoonsDESCR:0 "As armed cavalry became more important, Chargers, who could not wield weapons during a sprint, were replaced by horse-riding human auxiliaries. Eventually, the demands of military centralization resulted in these dragoons displacing even the famed elephant lords, as modern military tactics have no place for the vainglorious displays of individuals."

 hobgoblin_18_worg_cavalry:0 "Worg Cavalry"
 hobgoblin_18_worg_cavalryDESCR:0 "With the role of pursuit cavalry diminished on the modern battlefield, worg riders evolved their battlefield tactics to revolve around a decisive flanking charge.

 hobgoblin_23_hobgoblin_line_infantryDESCR:0 "As traditional melee weapons almost completely vanished from infantry use, prior formations had to be re-examined.

 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_cuirassier:0 "Worg Cuirassiers"
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_cuirassierDESCR:0 "Paradoxically, as firearms completely took over infantry regiments, they began to decline in use for cavalry.

 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_rifle:0 "Hobgoblin Riflemen"
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_rifleDESCR:0 "Fast, accurate, and astoundingly deadly, hobgoblin rifle regiments sacrificed range for a quicker reload time. Rifled barrels improved precision in the hands of a skilled and well-practiced user, leading to the fearsome reputation of hobgoblin sharpshooters."

 raheni_1_raheni_footsoldierDESCR:0 "Like other humans across Haless, early Raheni infantry consisted almost entirely of footsoldiers, armed with a spear, shield, and shortsword.

 raheni_5_nadimraj_infantry:0 "Nadimraj Infantry"
 raheni_5_nadimraj_infantryDESCR:0 "It was no mere fluke that the Nadimraj rose to be one of the first great civilizations in Rahen. By making use of semi-professional soldiers, who would train extensively during the monsoon seasons, the Nadimraj ensured a high standard of quality. The Nadimraj's old semi-professional soldiers were brought back into widespread use first out of necessity in the lands it once held, to counter the growing hobgoblin threat, but would eventually spread throughout Rahen."

 raheni_9_reformed_nadimraj_infantryDESCR:0 "Although the tactics of the Nadimraj reemerged in Rahen, they would prove outdated with the changing methods of warfare, and new combatants.

 raheni_12_khedarid_infantryDESCR:0 "The Khedarids where on the front-line against the vast hordes of hobgoblins threatening the Raj. As such, they would develop new tactics designed specifically to combat the hobgoblins. By making constant use of arrow-fire supplemented by newly-acquired blackpowder weapons, whilst the spearmen remained entrenched, the enemy would forced to come to them. These tactics would soon be adopted throughout Rahen as the hobgoblin menace grew."

 raheni_18_ghankedhen_musketeersDESCR:0 "Although blackpowder weapons would be used throughout Rahen, it was the newly emergent Gankedhen state which first made muskets its soldiers' primary weapon.

 raheni_23_nadimraj_musketeers:0 "Nadimraj Musketeers"
 raheni_23_nadimraj_musketeersDESCR:0 "The most major leap in the development of Raheni infantry was the combination of the Gankedhen usage of blackpowder with the semi-professional armies of the Nadimraj. During the monsoon months, rather than painstaking training with bows, soldiers would instead practice with their muskets for months on end, making Raheni musketeers some of the most accurate shots in the world."
 raheni_26_raheni_rifle:0 "Raheni Riflemen"
 raheni_26_raheni_rifleDESCR:0 "When rifles first arrived in Rahen, the Raheni were eager adopters, as they provided for much longer range than muskets, which fit well with the Raheni traditions of long-range combat. Coincidentally, it was during the arrival of the rifles that Raheni armies would first begin making use of the extremely effective line formations that were becoming common around the world."
 raheni_30_nadimraj_rifles:0 "Nadimraj Rifles"
 raheni_30_nadimraj_riflesDESCR:0 "With the widespread integration of rifles into Rahen, combined with the economic prosperity brought on through the globalisation of trade, many nations would begin switching from a semi-professional army to a professional one, training year round, not just emulating the armies of the Nadimraj, but surpassing them. Still, however, the name of Nadimraj Infantry would stick, as the idea of a professional army in Rahen had become inextricably linked to the legacy of the Nadimraj."

 raheni_6_nadimraj_cavalryDESCR:0 "As time went on, although the Raheni made extensive use of elephants, it gradually became clear that their elephant tactics and the newly adopted Nadimraj-style infantry tactics were not compatible. As such, elephants would, for a brief time,take on a more supportive role in Raheni warfare, acting as shock troops on the flanks, rather than on the front lines."
 raheni_10_stampede_cavalry:0 "Stampede Cavalry"
 raheni_10_stampede_cavalryDESCR:0 "In the early 1500s, the elephant riders of Dhujat would develop a new tactic, which was brutal, risky, and dangerous, but nonetheless effective. By deliberately riling up their mounts before battle, the Raheni would create an artificial stampede, bringing an element of pure chaos to their tactics that made their charges impossible for enemy commanders to accurately predict."

 raheni_14_ghavaanaj_elephant_lordsDESCR:0 "With the unification of Dhugajir, many of the Elephant-Lords would find themselves with less and less of a role in politics. As such, they would instead focus on their martial roles, training both themselves and their mounts into deadly weapons of war, armouring both themselves and their pachyderms in heavy plate. Soon, this tradition of Elephant-Lords could be found throughout Rahen, not dissimilar from the knights of Cannor."

 raheni_18_reformed_ghavaanaj_elephant_lordsDESCR:0 "As Raheni armies became more professional, the sporadic and interdependent nature of the Elephant-Lords began to become an issue, as Elephant-Lords would often disobey orders from generals out of a belief that they were of higher rank. As such, many reforms would take place to bring the Elephant-Lords in line, and make them a true, integrated part of Raheni armies."

 raheni_23_raheni_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Despite their long tradition of pachyderm-based warfare, many in Rahen, influenced by Cannorian armies, would begin adopting horseback dragoons, as they were simply faster and more mobile than elephants, albeit less strong. Although some, notably including the lords of Dhugajir, would refuse to adopt horseback warfare, for several decades it would become the norm in many Raheni armies."
 raheni_28_elephant_cannons:0 "Elephant Cannons"
 raheni_28_elephant_cannonsDESCR:0 "By the 18th century, however, elephants would return to Rahen in full force, with the advent of Pachyderm Artillery.

 ynnic_26_dismounted_ynnic_knights:0 "Dismounted Ynnic Knights"
 ynnic_26_dismounted_ynnic_knightsDESCR:0 "Despite the nobility and prestige associated with their steed, Ynnic Knights were no strangers to fighting on foot. Before stirrups were adopted, most knights would in fact dismount and fight on foot during prolonged battles, and this role became prominent again during the late Age of Witch-Kings, thanks to the inspiration provided by Malacnar Companions. Dismounted Ynnic Knights or "Nohy Vytrie" were those knights who entered the battle already on foot, and they were most commonly last-born sons or lesser nobility, serving as elite infantry to rally the other troops and provide the mainstay of the Ynnic battle line. Donning full body armour and wielding greatswords, they slowly but surely advanced towards the enemy lines, deflecting enemy bullets from a distance. And once they were close enough to see their enemies eye to eye, they would dash towards them right before they could reload."

 ynnic_26_drozmateersDESCR:0 "As bayonet manufacturers were established across the Dragon Dominion, musketeers replaced pikemen for the Rzentur battle lines. Nicknamed "Drozmateers" by Cannorian merchants, these warriors were far scarier than their nickname made them out to be, as was the mass fire coming out of their green, dragonscale-like bladed muskets. In the Rzentur's signature combination of savagery and religious zeal, they formed a tactic that had alternating members of the line fire whilst the others charged at the enemy."

 ynnic_26_forest_eye_manhuntersDESCR:0 "Few Ruinborn know hardship and struggle as well as the Teira, who have lived for centuries in the frigid land of Dalaire under the constant threat of the Cursed Ones. Teira battle style is an extension of their lifestyle: small, secretive bands who scrape by while doing their best not to draw attention, but capable, if cornered, to set lethal ambushes against their would-be hunters. Having arrived to the Ynn thanks to a secret pathway through the Forest of the Cursed Ones known only to them, Teira were outfitted with weapons such as crossbows, spears and throwing daggers of a far higher quality than anything they were used to, but even under the service of Ynnic Lords they still continued wearing the same camouflage-painted fur coats their brethren did in Dalaire. This attire favoured their primary task: irregular warfare, skirmishes, ambushes and supply train disruption, providing a response to the frontiermen's own asymmetrical warfare and developing a fame as hunters of men second only to Wendigos. The sight of the Teira’s glowing eyes staring at you from the woods was enough to send common troops into a panic."

 ynnic_30_gospodic_platoonDESCR:0 "Gospodh Aranthiv of the Dragon Dominion came to rule a nation surrounded by colonial powers to the north and pioneer countries to the south; after a period of stay in Eordand where he witnessed the effectiveness of the Cannorian armies against his fellow Ruinborn, he became certain the only way forward would be to further modernize the Rzentur war machine. Discipline was enforced, and the previous Drozmateer tactic of charging at will into enemy lines was abolished; Gospodh Aranthiv deemed it "Improper of a modern army". Rather, platoon fire was developed, so that the Dominion's "mouths of fire" could keep "roaring" constantly in all moments of the battle."
 ynnic_30_longbow_knights:0 "Longbow Knights"
 ynnic_30_longbow_knightsDESCR:0 "To Ynnic Knights, the crossbow was seen as a devious device to fabricate strength, the shortbow was the weapon of lowly woodsmen and the composite bow was for bandits. But the longbow? Ynnic Knights admired the Damerian longbow, which required strength and years of training to use. Imported in the nineteenth century, it quickly became one of their favourite tools when out hunting. At the battle of Velencestor in 1811 400 knights fought in the frontline as heavily-armoured foot archers, and their arrows, glowing blue with magic, rained destruction on the enemy musketeer lines by buzzing through several men or exploding upon landing. The future Empress Morvel was leading these archers, having been the one to perfect those magical arrows during her exile in Veykoda. By her campaign's end, the Vytrie Rongukol - Longbow Knights - had grown into a 1000-strong regiment, and more were commissioned during her reign. Veykodan rune magic was applied to both the bows and armour of the knights, with carvings in elegant patterns that enhanced not only the beauty, but also the performance of their equipment. The longbows, with largest surface area of all types of bow, were optimal for rune magic."

To stave off conquest attempts, a standing militia was raised and this was further supplemented by Cannorian instructors and mercenaries, who experimented in a wide array of tactics to both counter the mass fire of the Dominion and the Sarda magical knights."

True to their factionalist indole, there were two different Tuathak Foreign Legions of which one served the Dragon Dominion, the other the new Sarda Empire. While those of the Dragon Dominion unleashed the power of Eordand's new deadly magirifles, those under the Sarda Empire were infamous for slowly starving their prisoners to death before throwing their bodies into the river, and in battle they wielded poison-laced copper swords similar to Dracball, the sword of Artorean the Dragonslayer, with an obvious message."

Given a light chainmail and a overhand lance, all Ynnic Squires need to do is keep hold of their horse, and steer the magnificient beast as it does most of the job on its own goring and trampling the enemies to death."

With one major difference: Ynnic horses have antlers! A Ynnic knight's favourite method of fighting, when the charge wasn't enough, was to jump down onto the ground and unsheathe his sword, cutting down all enemies who would be as foolhardy as to not break and rout at the sight of his charge."

 ynnic_10_barded_dolindhan_knightsDESCR:0 "Ynnics held antler horses as the most sacred of animals, and thus their protection in battle was not only a tactical concern, but also a display of piety and virtue. And why invest all your money into heavy plate armour for yourself, when you needed mobility in order to acrobatically jump off anyway? Due to their proximity to the ironhouses of Brelar, Dolindhan knights were the first to be able to afford horse armour consistently, and they often overlayed it with cloth in the colour of their suzerain's emblem. Most famously, the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst flaunted a bright purple barding."

The "Vitre Zomajico" regiment was comprised of former Dolindhan nobility intermarried with Rzentur elites, and it became the most feared instrument of the Dominion. These Draconic Knights were outfitted in a green, Balgaric-style spiked armour that made them betray no emotion, and, as they traced their lineage to the Dragon-God himself through their Rzentur side, their dragon blood allowed them to wield powerful magic: magic that made them impervious to anything short of a cannonball."

 cave_goblin_9_goblin_legionDESCR:0 "Prior to the rise of Korgus Dookanson, most battles fought by Cave Goblins had been small affairs or in the company of orcs who bullied them into some semblance of order. Left to their own devices, the goblins quickly realized the inadequacy of their traditional disorganized warfare. When assembled in an army they were capable of little more than a massed attack, which often meant their enemies escaping to fight another day. It was a goblin of the Railskulker clan who first came up witht the idea of replacing orcish bullies with goblin ones. These bullies would each be responsible for keeping a section of the army in line, allowing them to pull of more complicated large scale tactics such as ambushes."

 cave_goblin_12_cavern_burner_teamsDESCR:0 "It is no secret that goblins love explosions and flames. So when one goblin invented a way to combine both into a small clay globe, this new weapon became the fad of warfare among the Cave Goblins. Working in small teams, these cavern burners would launch frenzied charge designed to get them close enough to throw their dangerous payloads, resulting in wicked peals of laughter from the gleeful goblins as their targets burned alive. The smoke of the burning enemy would sometimes suffocate the rest of the enemy to death. Inspired by this, the goblins began bringing piles of rags which they would intentionally light on fire to wage primitve chemical warfare on their enemies. When out of rags, the weakest goblins among the bunch would suffice too, set alight and pushed screaming towards the enemy army. Casualties of such efforts were high, but life is cheap among goblins, and the chance to blow someone up is often a hotly desired item."

 cave_goblin_23_quickspray_formationDESCR:0 "An evolution of previous bullet swarm tactics, the Quickspray Formation was emblematic of the increasing professionalism of goblin armies in later years. Reminiscient of Cannorian line infantry, initial Quickspray Formations utilized designated reloaders who would hand off new guns to the goblins at front. Quickly, the goblins realized they could double their firepower if the goblins in front were actually two goblins stacked together. From there it was not long until the standard tactic became literally filling a tunnel top to bottom with the goblins and their reloaders. While amusing at first glance, such formations proved deadly to all who faced them."

As goblin armies and soldiers usually carried massive amounts of explosives, they would simply use these to shape the battlefield to their liking, rather than relying on finding the proper place to fight. Initial experiments with these tactics ended in disaster, but the uncharacteristic stubborness of the leading goblin generals of Udzen Troice meant that the tactic was eventually perfected. Dwarf and hobgoblin armies alike both learned about this new tactic in deafening assaults that often left both sides with much of their own under the rubble. Such is the cost of blowing up your enemies."

Proof of this need be found no further than the contributions of military artificers to the massed sapper tactics of the cave goblins. Armed with a decent selection of scatterguns, an assortment of knives, an a whole heap of explosives, goblin sapper commandos and their artificer leaders are the terror of the Dwarovar. Moving quickly between caverns and tunnels with explosives and artificer digging tools, these raiders can lead whole goblin armies in supremely effective ambushes, or conduct their own operations to explosively sabotage enemy armies. Many a dwarf army has found their own artillery exploding in their camp thanks to these teams."

Pulled by various cave beasts and sometimes even propelled by artificer devices, the wagons carried a platoon of goblin soldiers alongside the equipment needed to dig through thin sections of cavern. Early digging wagons were used mainly to set up ambushes of enemy armies who thought they knew the terrain around them, but as technology advanced, the greater use of explosives and artificer digging devices allowed digging wagons to open up new routes of attack at will during a battle."

In addition, mandatory equine training will be taught in public schooling to ensure the availability of skilled riders for the Corps. In order to properly allocate resources and education, students that show early promise will continue their riding lessons, while the rest of the students will be taught infantry drill lessons."

 gerudian_30_skibazraniDESCR:0 "The cold, harsh north of Cannor and Gerudia has always been difficult terrain for armies to maneuver, but with the introduction of skis to the military the constricted swathes of snow can be made into an advantage. Although skis are not a new invention, the mass production of high-quality skis has revolutionized the mobility of infantry in polar latitudes."

 gerudian_30_reforged_ebonsteelDESCR:0 "The ways of the forefathers echo with every footfall of the Einherjar, clad in Ebonsteel and armed with axe like the ancient heroes. With the formula for Ebonsteel alloy rediscovered, the forges of Gerudia produce suits of armor once more. Renowned for its resistance to shattering and relatively low weight, Ebonsteel also spites the shot that once ended the steel armor of old. After the bulk of the infantry fire volleys upon the enemy, the Ebonsteel Einherjar lead the charge upon the enemy and laugh as shot bounces and bayonet crumple!"
