 dartaxagerdim_events.1.t:0 "Ancient site Found!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.1.d:0 "After years of searching the country side and a dozen failed digs, our archaeologists have finally found what we were looking for: an ancient site that seems to be from the period of Djinn Sulatanates! What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing hiding genies from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way."

 dartaxagerdim_events.2.d:0 "The study of magic is an investment of generations, as such it has taken years to study ancient magics. Now, after some of the best minds of our college have bent themselves over the genie artifacts, they have been able to extract some spells from their depths. These spells all seem to revolve around one specific school of magic. We have been able to learn ancient Genie secrets from the great school of..."

 dartaxagerdim_events.3.t:0 "A Faithful Decision"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.d:0 "Once the faith was clear. Surakel had sacrificed himself for the safety of our people. But with the coming of Jaher to Brasan the priests down in Bulwar declared him to be his divine incarnation. He did well, he freed us from the gnolls and forged Bulwar into a great empire. But he died, and his successors the 'Sun' Elves have been but pale impressions of his radiance. Now there is disagreement, many say the Sun Elves now all share the spirit of Surakel. But in the far east a group of Sun Elves has started saying that it's not only Sun Elves that have to fulfill Surakel's duties but that it falls to all. However there are still those closer to home that say that Jaher was never the incarnation of Surakel and that we must still wait for the reincarnation of our Sun God. What do we believe?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.a:0 "Jaher was a fraud, we must wait longer still."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.b:0 "After Jaher, Surakel's duties fall to us all."
 dartaxagerdim_events.3.c:0 "I guess the Sun Elves are the true successors?"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.t:0 "Ziggurat of Surakel has been completed!"
 dartaxagerdim_events.4.d:0 "It has been slowly arising over the city of [Root.GetName], now finally it is complete. Thousands of masons, hundreds of sculptors, dozens of painters and metalworkers have laboured for ten years to complete this marvel of architecture. We have truly built one of the wonders of the world. Let the world see the glory of Surakel!"
