Its keep, with a hundred floors and several attached towers, links at the summit with the Ynnic Plateau by a drawbridge.

A spiral tower of the most lucent teal, it has been decorated with floral patterns, waves and clouds on the outside. Its interior is wide enough to allow an open atrium, at the center of which rises a marble pillar with the statues of important elves carved onto its sides. To connect guests and travellers to the Ynnic plateau, a wide, winding staircase hugs the tower's walls, twisting and turning as it rises around the pillar, all the way to the upper floor parallel to the Cliffs of Ruin. On the walls, a diagonal mural accompanies the staircase, depicting episodes of elven history from the War of Broken Chains, to the Ruin of Aelantir, to the landing of Munas to Endrallian's rediscovery of Aelantir in 1500 AA.\n\nWhile scholars are still at work uncovering secrets of elven history and, as they do, they are bound to find inaccuracies with some of the mural's portrayals, none can deny its artistic power: guests often travel the entire length of the tower without realizing, engrossed as they are in following the mural."

While not the most glamorous or extravagant of the cliff passages, the Arbeloch Ascensor is the fastest and safest way to get through, being able to lift heavy cargo or several regiments per trip in a state-of-the-art feat of engineering efficiency."
