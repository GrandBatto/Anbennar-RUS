Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

It is said that a hall of a hundred storytellers couldn't tell the full Dwarven folklore even if they had a hundred years to do it. Their story was ancient by the time of Aul-Dwarov, and the rise and fall of that great empire only left behind more tragedies and tales of grandeur. Inspired by the heroes of old, many dwarves look towards the Dwarovar, All-Dwarves-Home, in order to reclaim the history and lands they have lost."

It was where the Dwarovkron was forged to unify all dwarfkind, and it was where the High Assembly of Holds met to advise its bearer. It was also where the surface terrace farms of the Serpent's Vale were managed, in which the High King could feed all his subjects food to sustain themselves in the dark depths of the mountain."
   HOLY_SITE_4311_DESC:0 "Grônstunad wasn’t the first hold founded after the Tree of Stone was breached, but no doubt one of the wealthiest. It grew quickly, overflowing with deposits of jade that were extracted and shipped west, creating a ‘jade rush’ composed of dwarves looking to find such a great deposit, or escape the dwarven wars of unification in the west. Eventually the west fell to the new orc menace and Grônstunad became the greatest Dwarven city in existence... for a time. By the time the surviving dwarves of the west regained the confidence to make contact with the east Grônstunad was no more, and was now the home of the hobgoblin race."
   HOLY_SITE_2931_DESC:0 "Er-Natvir was not only one of the core cities of the Dwarovar, but also the hub in which all rails sprouted from. All goods passing through to and from the capital passed through this hold, and the libraries, holding uncountable trade records, are a beautiful site to behold- a testament of Dwarven organization. Even in the final days of this city, goods were still recorded- mostly arms."
   HOLY_SITE_4078_DESC:0 "Named after Hehogrim the Diligent, Hehodovar was where many of the first holds were designed and architected. Based at the centre of the Dwarovar, it was allegedly the first capital of the dwarven peoples but by the time of unification it had become a place of the practical arts of crafting and building."
   HOLY_SITE_2963_DESC:0 "Jorkad Hall was a hold of no importance... until one day a dark scourge emerged from its depths. These beasts were named after the hold itself, but to the greater world, they were known by a simpler name: Orcs. Deadlier than the goblins that had infested the mountains, the orcish threat brought doom to upon dwarves. Since that day, dwarfkind lost their dominion over the mountains, and over the millennia more and more holds would perish under the orcish menace."
   HOLY_SITE_4093_DESC:0 "Arg-Ôrdstun was the capital of the Serpent's Reach, who in its day was oft unified against the High King of Aul-Dwarov. Meaning the Diamond Reach, it is said that the riches of the Dwarovar was controlled by the Ôrdstunic dwarves, and many diamonds to this day can trace its origin back to this powerful hold."
   HOLY_SITE_4269_DESC:0 "It was said that Halanna, the Earthmother, created the first dwarves in Earthseed, and it was with their help that the fine details of the world were perfected. When she died it was said that her heart was buried in her most favourite places, in order to watch over her finest creations from beyond - indeed, she did, and now the depths that Earthseed finds itself has now earned the namesake relating to Halanna: the Tree of Stone."

Ravelianists are part-scholar, part-preacher, and believe in unraveling the secrets of the world to discover and spread its fundamental Truths. A large number of these revelations come from their research in the God Fragment, a strange shard-like device that communicates in a near-undecipherable language that claims that it is the last portion of divinity, and that the precursor elves stole God's divinity and turned it into what we know today as magic. A popular tenet in the Ravelian faith is their wish to use artificery to bring this stolen magic to all."

While obscured by history, there had been some cases of peaceful coexistence in small pockets of the Deepwoods, such as Salla Ahain, and peaceful integration on a larger scale would be seen under the Overclan following its formation. However, the most prominent and mutually beneficial examples come from the Moon Elves of Cannor.\n\nThe historical record's first well-documented instance of these friendships came when a group of Ibevari adventurers, appalled by the Thorn Company's vicious treatment of newly-liberated goblin slaves offered their protection. Following peacekeeping service in the Ibevari reformation, the refugees were eventually resettled in Thanas. In later years, elven and goblin magnates would operate as a factional bloc in the Northern League's parliament, finding allies as minority groups marginalized by Gawedi hegemony.\n\nCulturally, this manifested as a tradition known as Silver Shamanism,wherein goblins would adopt elven magics and language, as well as material traditions such as architecture and styles of craft. The practice was considered endearing enough to warrant the aid of the more progressive segments of elven society's aid. Elves, either for pragmatic convenience or out of sincere admiration for their little imitators, offer consultancy and obscure techniques in industry and warfare in exchange for the numbers and technological innovation that goblins could provide in return, each party shoring up the other's relative weaknesses."

   gerudian_cult_desc:0 "The flighty nature of goblins has long been known, and our shamans have long had trouble keeping an audience when in competition with the other diversions and amusements that our people so frequently indulge in. Thusly, inspired by the captivating storytelling and beautiful songs of the northern skalds, our religious leaders have adopted window-shaking worship sessions, wherein booming music, complex lyrics, and vibrantly costumed dance hold the tales of our gods and the traditions of our people fresh in our minds. Furthermore, our earnest embrace of these musics, along with the incorporation of the Skalds' songs into our worship has inspired some among their number to share the secrets of their bardic magics, which inspire our people and bolster our armies."

   fey_cult_desc:0 "While they long predated the arrival of the Wood Elves, the Forest Goblins were hardly as successful in their dealings with the fair folk of the Deepwoods. Eventually, though, a period of peaceful coexistence alongside in the river glade Ahain would give birth to a new form of thought. While the elves had developed a formalized system of rituals and appeasement to keep the fey from intefering in their affairs, the goblins simply designated an unfortunate few as Feykeepers. Made to live in (comparatively) ramshackle huts outside the borders of their villages, these baelfully unfortunate individuals would be made to bear the brunt of the fey's curses, and be dispatched to be on the wrong end of every tricky deal."

Their gods are all but gone, left in scraps and pieces spread apart through all their kind, their essences shattered to pieces and sitting in the gullets of every ogre and troll. Yet even in this state, gods are difficult to kill, and there are shamans that today sense their presence, even if only partly so: their half-digested consciousnesses stretched out in a void between sentience and oblivion, referred to as a collective mass, a maw of terror that whispers into its shamans' ears sweet and terrible nothings, asking only that their chosen may eat and eat for they no longer can."
   centaur_cult:0 "Kravi Oznad"
   centaur_cult_desc:0 "The concept of a great home for goblins hidden below the earth is one prevalent in almost all goblin cults, Jazhkredu as it is known takes many forms depending on the believer of what god you are speaking to. Some envision it as a great and endless treasury, others an endless field of mushrooms and spoils, others yet deny it completely and see nothing but a gasping oblivion of gnashing teeth. But the believers of a certain cult not only accept its existence, but outright claim it is a pale underling to the true heaven of the goblins: the titular Kravi Oznad, a beyond greater than even heaven. \n\n This coveted greater heaven is whatever one desires, an endless amount of it in a plane of plenty that stretches further beyond what one can see, the only way one can achieve invitation to this heaven beyond heavens however is to die in a most goblinlike manner, and only that way. All goblin believers of this cult are to take arms, ride upon the battlefield and slay all those who oppose the goblin way of life, any means necessary. Whether it be dying of a misfire in the heat of battle, the explosion of an ill-timed missile, or simple slaying at the hands of a dwarf or otherwise after having killed tens of others, death is the only way to surpass the mediocre afterlife and achieve the heaven a goblin man or woman truly deserves!"

Followers of this philosophy are uninterested by spirituality; instead focusing on creating and refining a “Theory of Everything” that explains exactly how reality works. Members are driven to observe and analyse the material world, in the hopes of being able to incorporate their discoveries to the doctrine in an act known as “Being touched by The Thought”. This drive towards material analysis and innovation leads to followers of the Thought being well-suited to the pursuit of scientific advancement and the development of artifice; gnomish believers in the Thought were the first to combine magic and science into the art now known as artificery. Those who follow The Thought are usually very tolerant to other ways of thinking, as they both hold the product of other people’s intelligence in high regard, and take advantage of the opportunity to research into other cultures."

   mystic_accord_religion_desc:0 "The ancient and spiritual faith that used to dominate Haless before the rise of the Righteous Path, and is now only found in the place of its supposed origin, the Lupulan Rainforest plus small pockets of Bomdan and the Ringlet Isles. The Mystic Accord, in the most simplest of terms, is the complete symbiotic union between people and the spirits scattered all across Haless. Unlike Righteous Path which has evolved to separate man and spirit, the Mystic Accord holds on to the belief and humans and spirits are equal in terms of treatment and worship. Many of the larger spirits involve notable geographical locations or abstract features, such as the sky or the Lupulan Rainforest. The followers of the Mystic Accord depend on these large spirits to protect and guide the people throughout their lives, and perform many rituals to offer thanks to them. The Mystic Accord also notably abhor the High God temples that appear across Haless due to their suppression of the spirits, outright destroying or neglecting any of the temples held in Myatic Accord territory. Less organized than the Righteous Path and especially High Philosphy, it is difficult for many conversions to the Mystic Accord, making it a dying faith to those who not utterly devoted."
