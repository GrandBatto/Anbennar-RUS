   ADV_growing_population_title:0 "Settling Escann"

   ADV_jewel_title:0 "Reinvite Artisans"
   ADV_jewel_desc:0 "If we are to have a strong economy, we need to export more than cattle, grain and Orcish slaves. Escann has a few gem deposits and, if we can find one of them, we can start inviting artisans from Cannor to help utilize these mines."
   ADV_monetary_system_title:0 "Our Own Crowns"
   ADV_monetary_system_desc:0 "While using golden crowns minted in Cannor has long worked to serve our economy, we can not properly resettle the land while being dependent on the old currency. It is time to find a source of gold in Escann and make a coin of our own."
   ADV_farm_of_country_title:0 "Restore the Farmlands"

   ADV_great_forge_title:0 "Forging Our Swords"
   ADV_great_forge_desc:0 "While Cannorian steel is strong and sturdy we can not rely on importing our weapons if we are to fight the orcs day in, day out. It is time to find a good and stable source of iron and forge our own blades!"
   
   ADV_node_power_title:0 "Controlling Local Trade"

   ADV_trade_power_title:0 "Trade Economy"
   ADV_trade_power_desc:0 "The early days of the Greentide are gone and as we begin to properly settle the land, it has become important that we can secure a more complex network of trade routes to the west and properly utilize the surplus of goods that Escann produces."
   ADV_adventurer_in_workforce_title:0 "Adventurers in the Workforce"
   ADV_adventurer_in_workforce_desc:0 "As we attract more and more adventures, we need to start asking more of these brave men and women of Cannor. It is time to ask them to arm themselves not just with swords, but with plows!"
   
   ADV_forcelimit_title:0 "Adventurer Army"
   ADV_forcelimit_desc:0 "While we are heavily reliant on the average adventurer for resettling the land, we do still need a group of adventurers we can trust to always be ready to defend our borders and push back the orcs."
   ADV_2_prov_title:0 "Consolidating Our Gains"
   ADV_2_prov_desc:0 "Our victories and adventures in Escann have granted many of our members riches, accolades and stories to tell. However, now the real work begins.

Let them spend their gold and treasures on their needs and wants, but also remind them that reinvesting it in the company can help secure their future."
   ADV_3_prov_title:0 "Supply Train Pioneers"
   ADV_3_prov_desc:0 "As we continue to secure new territories in Escann, more and more have joined our company's supply train, offering goods and services, from hunters selling meats to whores selling their bodies. These people, whether they have come from Cannor for a better life, or are former Escanni refugees who have returned home, are no doubt the backbone of our endeavours here. They are under our protection, and we should treat them as a country should treat its citizens."
   ADV_capital_region_title:0 "Home"
   ADV_capital_region_desc:0 "While not all of us come from the same place, in Escann every one of us found a fledgling home. As such we absolutely need to secure the area surrounding our capital, to establish a core that can attract both old and new Escanni to our lands."
   ADV_build_frenzy_title:0 "Rebuilding the Villages"
   ADV_build_frenzy_desc:0 "While reconquering the land from the orcs is our foremost aim, we still need to rebuild old villages and establish a working infrastructure. Time to put these new settlers to good use!"
   ADV_guild_integration_title:0 "Establish Tax Office"
   ADV_guild_integration_desc:0 "As our land grows more and more developed and our villages are rebuilt, it is time to establish a more organized taxation system. Through this, we can accrue more income to the state as well as have a corps of able bodied bureaucrats ready to introduce newly conquered lands into our administration. "
   
   ADV_prestigious_adventurer_title:0 "Successful Adventures"
   ADV_prestigious_adventurer_desc:0 "Our success in Escann has made the other adventurers talk about us, and as we know, for adventurers, it's not about who you are but what you've achieved."
   ADV_war_ork_title:0 "The Green Threat"
   ADV_war_ork_desc:0 "We must never forget, nor forgive the orcs for what they have done. It is time to finish what Corin started and strike back and reclaim Escann from the greenskins or die trying!"
   ADV_standing_army_title:0 "Standing Army"
   ADV_standing_army_desc:0 "Ever since the Greentide, the orcish threat — organized or disorganized — exists everywhere in Escann.

   ADV_one_colon_title:0 "Need for Settled Lands"

   ADV_ally_title:0 "Not Alone"
   ADV_ally_desc:0 "We are not the only ones fighting the orcs here in Escann and, since we have a common threat and lots of free land, we have a clear reason to work together."
   ADV_ally_cooperation_title:0 "Cooperation"
   ADV_ally_cooperation_desc:0 "Different issues require different people, different resources require different skilled workers. As such we can help our neighbour with their issues and they can help us with ours."
   ADV_organize_capital_title:0 "Urbanize [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
   ADV_organize_capital_desc:0 "A capital is a representation of the state it leads. Just like how Lorentainé shows the beauty of Lorent, our capital must show the potential prosperity we offer. And so we need it to be more than just some holding, we need it to be a proper city!"
