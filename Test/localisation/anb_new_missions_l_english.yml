When the first Eordans left the Domandrod after the cataclysms that ravaged the land, the people were all united in the tenets taught by the Fey. As the years passed and lands resettled, some of the Eordans began to favor one season over the rest, abandoning their faith for idolatry. The faithful few, the Peitar, who kept to the traditions were united by the first Pelodan, who swore to restore the balance of the seasons throughout Eordand to the Domandrod Fey. Alas, their cause failed as Pelodan was slain by the heretics, as the enemies of the Eordellon rallied behind the restors of Arakeprun. Ever since his defeat, the Peitar have been splintered having lost their faith in the Oathsworn, and the leaders of Pelomar have stubbornly sworn one after the oath taken so long ago."

Henrik used this region as a staging point for further raids along the Divenhal Sea, and with their maritime traditions they soon discovered countless pearls among the shellfish on the sea bed. Over the years they have become more like their Damerian neighbours than their ancestors, although they retain some of their Skaldhyrric traditions of Skalds in the worship of Munas Moonsinger.

The Skaldhyrric faith centralized and reformed in this time, partially to stop conversions to these new faiths, and partially to create patriotic fervor in the kingdom in it's struggles against Gawed. The Skaldhyrric League was founded by the Konungr and the united Skalds of Gerudia and the newly created temples in the Alenic Reach, where all the regions of the kingdom worked together in efficent cooperation to stop the advance of their enemies."

His dynasty ruled Castanor until 1015 AA, when Castan LIII's enthrallment was broken which led to his death by Nichmer the Sorceror King. Fortunately he was succeeded by two sons and a daughter: Garrec unsuccesfully attempting to reclaim Castanor, the Urvic went north and reclaimed his namesake, Castan Ebonfrost's ancestral home of Urviksten, and Alvara married Urion Starsworn of Silurion fame.
