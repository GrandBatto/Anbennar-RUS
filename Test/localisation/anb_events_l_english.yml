 flavor_clouded_eye.1.d:0 "Grama Clouded Eye is old.\n\nShe is old enough to remember a time before Korgus lived, when the orcs still fought each other over scraps in the Dwarovar. She is old enough to remember when the Dookan first came to her in a vision, letting her know of his son's coming. She is old enough to remember when she first laid eyes on Korgus, and knew immediately that he was the Dookan's chosen child. She is old enough to remember when the Dookanson chose her as his personal shaman, and commanded her to spread the word of his coming to the rest of the orcs. She is old enough to remember the start of the Greentide, when thousands upon thousands of orcs spilled out into Escann, seeking victory and glory for the Dookan and his son... And seeking a better life for themselves and all of the orcish race, away from the poverty of the Dwarovar. And she is old enough to remember when Korgus fell, the true child of her beloved Dookan, slain by the human Corin.\n\nGrama Clouded Eye is old enough to remember all of that... And is old enough to know that her time to pass into the arms of the Great Dookan is fast approaching."

 flavor_clouded_eye.2.t:0 "The Death of Grama Clouded Eye"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.d:0 "She is dead. The woman who was said to have spoken directly with the Great Dookan himself in her visions, is dead. The woman who once insulted Varok Bladebreaker to his face and lived to tell the tale, is dead. The woman who rallied the disparate clans and tribes to the Dookanson's call, is dead. Grama Clouded Eye is dead, and the entire clan mourns.\n\nIt was as she lay on her death bed that she finally chose who her successor as clan chief would be. She had said that the Great Dookan himself had pointed out three exceptional young orcs to her in a vision, each exemplifying his strength in a different way, and each of which would be powerful clan chiefs in their own right.\n\nBagrum was no great warrior, and was often ridiculed by other orcs supposedly cowering behind defenses of his own construction. However, the Great Dookan knows that strength does not come only from a blade or a club. The other orcs stopped laughing at Bagrum once he saved them from a deadly charge of Cannorian knights with defenses he had hidden in the tall grass. The Dookan's children must have homes to live in and walls to protect themselves, and Bagrum would build those for his people.\n\nMeshug had always been considered soft by the other orcs. Whereas most of the Dookanson's followers were content to raid and pillage, Meshug found no satisfaction in such actions. Instead, Meshug spent hours in his tent, creating all of the things that other orcs simply stole from the lands they conquered. Why would Meshug waste so much time and effort making things, the other orcs asked, when he could just take them? Because, Meshug said, the Great Dookan is glorified not just in victorious battle, but in hard work, as well, in productive labor, to make life better for all of his children.\n\nKrunaka is the strongest warrior in Clouded Eye, able to best any male with ease. Unlike most orcs, though, Krunaka does not fight for the honor of the glory of it. No... Krunaka fights for peace. Other orcs laugh at her for it, of course. An orc that wants peace? What sort of orc is that? The Great Dookan, however, understands the strength that comes in peace, and would see Krunaka defeat the orcs' enemies and end decades of war and death.\n\nNo matter who Grama chose as her successor, the Clouded Eye clan would follow, for shaman's word was taken to be the word of the Great Dookan himself, whom none of the orcs would oppose. Who will Grama choose as the next clan chief?"
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.a:0 "Bagrum, he who seeks homes and walls for orcs."
 flavor_clouded_eye.2.b:0 "Meshug, he who seeks prosperity and wealth for orcs."

 gerudia.6.d:0 "The Council of Skalds remains defiant in these times: none may order them, none are above the supremacy of the Master Skald. They have asked our diplomats to leave, politely."
 gerudia.6.a:0 "Betrayal, what Skalds are these to question Me!?"
 gerudia.7.t:0 "Bjarnrik Pushes Claims"
 gerudia.7.d:0 "The Bjarnriki diplomats have thought on our discussion, and have decided that they do not value our decision. Claiming that the Skalds are to be subservient to the Konungr, they have declared that our Council is unfit to serve and lands our unrightfully held."
 gerudia.7.a:0 "But it was a generous offer!"
 gerudia.8.t:0 "Principality of Celmaldor"
 gerudia.8.d:0 "The fair city of Maldarion the Navigator thought they could unite the Reachmen to stop our expansion and take the Jotunsglotta, but they have failed. Their armies have surrendered, the city is ours. However, they still hold great influence across the cities and trading fleets. It may be wise to allow them some autonomy and utilize their connections, or should be seize their port directly? The Gerudians have long been envious of Celmaldor's extensive and beautiful docks, our shipwrights eager to utilize them."

 gerudia.9.d:0 "It has been many years since Deranne has been conquered and integrated, with new generations being born and raised under the Crown of Bera. The Derranic people were once like Gerudians before becoming a shade of the Lorentish, but over these new generations the people have begun to adopt their Gerudian roots again. Once and now known as the Talderranics, this country has become an integral part of Gerudian culture oncemore."

 gerudia.10.t:0 "Children of Henrik Divenscourge"
 gerudia.10.d:0 "Henrik Divenscourge conquered modern Pearlsedge from the old Tretunic Kingdom, a realm wedged between the then faltering kingdoms of Lorent and Dameria. His son Harald founded the Pearlman dynasty by marrying with the local Andarta Tretunis, whose bloodline continued all the way to the modern síl na Trísfers. The Reaver settlers of this land became the Pearlsedgers, and have over time become more and more like their Damerian neighbours. After the reclamation of Henrik's kingdom, the people of this land have returned the practices of their founder, becoming known as the Perlatter."
 gerudia.10.a:0 "May Henrik's sons have many more children!"

 gerudia.11.t:0 "Artificers and Skalds"
 gerudia.11.d:0 "The hum and churn of the furnaces threaten to overtake the chanting and singing of the Skalds in this industrial age. Both see each other as enemies, either as reactionary or radical, unwilling to make compromise. Both offer a vision for the Bjarnri's future: the Skalds wish to spread the tales throughout the world so that Elkaesal will never wake, and the Artificers wish to be rid of the shackles of the past and enter a new age of gears, smoke, and iron."
 gerudia.11.a:0 "The Skalds have never failed us!"

 eordand.3.t:0 "Demands of the Domandrod"
 eordand.3.d:0 "With the conquest and destruction of Pelodard, the Domandrod Fey have lost their most loyal subjects. A message arrived in your palace in the midst of the night upon your table, written on a curious silky paper and with gracefully curving script. Despite the beautiful penmanship and sweet words, they are outraged by your actions, demanding your presence and explanation for your actions. Their call is not one to be denied. \n\nYou travel from Arakeprun with a small entourage, ready for the long journey to the Domandrod. You pass from the grandeur of Spring Court cities to the hinterlands in the east. Here the trees grow thick, and civilization sparse. Watching from above on the treetops, the Peitar look at you accusingly. Your loyal guards look around suspiciously with polearm and bow ready in hand, primed for threat to your person. But harm never comes to you, and before long even the homes of the Peitar dissapear into the deep forest of the Domandrod. The air is still and the glades calm, but all feels as tense as a drawn bowstring. Your journey is not over yet, but in this moment you hesitate and ponder over yourself. What is it you truly want, what is guiding your actions? It cannot be a mere whim that you wake every day, every day that you command the fates of countless souls? \n\nYou command your caravan to stop for a rest by a small spring glistening from the sunlight that has pierced through the twilight of the Domandrod. While the camp is set up you walk over to the pond with your personal guard Nestrin. You gaze into the still but clear water disturbed only by placid butterflies, you gaze into your reflection and truly realize who you are. \n\nThen you see in the reflections of the water an enchantingly beautiful woman draped in vines and a crown of rose thorn. Turning around, you see a monstrously huge man with a grotesquely horned mask, like a mass of antlers in every direction. The woman speaks to you with an unnerving smile. \n\n"What have you seen in the pool? Not all who enter the forest come here, but those who do always have a guilty conscience. I know that you are a leader most powerful, that your every word is one that carries great weight. So tell me, O great leader, what words will you say today? What will you say to justify your crimes?"
 eordand.3.a:0 "I aim to put an end to war amongst ourselves by uniting Eordand!"

 eordand.5.t:0 "Excavation of Cadcimn"
 eordand.5.d:0 "After many years of hard toil excavating the soil and stone of this forsaken land, we have found it! A great Precursor ruin beneath the sands, the source of the artifacts the Fograc brought to us. Although many of the buildings and towers are collapsed in the bowels of the earth, they still hold marvels inside that have made our expedition well worth it. For now on this land will be known as Cadcimn, as it holds memories of the Precursor past as yet unknown to as from Eordand."
 eordand.5.a:0 "Marvelous news, Cadcimn will rise!"
 eordand.6.t:0 "Foray into the Depths of Cadcimn"
 eordand.6.d:0 "Our brave adventurers have ventured in the depths of Cadcimn for a year, discovering not only riches but dangers innumerable. After many unfortunate deaths, they have discovered a passageway with a magical intersection. There are two paths, and entering one will close off the other forever. Which path should be chosen?"
 eordand.6.a:0 "The left passage gleams of gold!"
 eordand.6.b:0 "Arcanists have told us that the right passageway has a stronger aura."
 eordand.7.t:0 "Haunt from the Deep"
 eordand.7.d:0 "On a dark evening with clear sky and bright moon, you survey the capital. For years now the ruins of Cadcimn unearthed miracles that have enriched your city in Eordand, and you eagerly anticipate further news from the expedition. You feel a tug in your mind, a hunch, and turn around. Behind you is a shadowy figure, contrasted against the magical lights bathing your balcony. Clutched in its tenebrous hands you see a small but wickedly shaped dagger. \n\n"Are you prepared to answer for your crimes?," a graven, solemn voice utters. "What was buried was meant to be forgotten. What has started cannot be undone, but who is responsbile may die." "
 eordand.7.a:0 "I am to trust in my sword in this dark time."
 eordand.8.t:0 "The Stars Beneath the Earth"
 eordand.8.d:0 "After consulting the knowledge of the Vernal Archives in Arakeprun for many sleepless evenings, I have made a profound discovery. Along the coast of Letih, fishermen found tiny glimmering clasts of some mineral compound among the sands some hundred years back. In my silken nightrobe I roused the court, and ordered an investigation into this legend. True enough, after extensive dredging of sand, more of these substance was found: none other than Damestear itself. But most importantly, the source was found, a buried ruin beneath the sands. Inside a long forgotten chamber was used by the Precursors to summon forth Damestear into our very own land. Although the art long defunct, the latent power of this facility can still be utilized to extract some Damestear, as long as energy still remains."
 eordand.8.a:0 "What a splendid bounty, with only me to thank!"
 eordand.9.t:0 "The Oathsworn Legacy"
 eordand.9.d:0 "Dating back centuries ago to Pelodan the First, the Oathsworn dynasty has been beholden to reunite the Eordan peoples and end the seasonal heretics. Swearing an oath to bring back the heretics to the Fey Lords, Pelodan the First lead the united Peitar people on a holy crusade. He failed in his mission, and confidence was forever lost in the Oathsworn, leading to even the Peitar peoples splitting off into different states. Since then, Pelodan's descendants have clung to the past glory and infamy attached to their name, nostalgic of a victory that could have been. The oath still stands, with each heir to Pelomar swearing the same oath to the Fey Lords."
 eordand.9.a:0 "Our duty we must fulfill."
 eordand.10.t:0 "Colltin Purchase - Choices"
 eordand.10.d:0 "The ownership of Colltin has been a contentious debate between Pelomar and Sidpar, with both sides only agreeing that a decision must be made. This parcel of seemingly worthless land is nonetheless important to Pelomar, as we are unconnected to the venerated Domandrod. \n\nSources within Sidpar whisper that they be willing to give Colltin to us. Sidpar has struggled against the Summer Court realms, and would do well to gain an advantage against them. Should we offer them a deal, offering them support in eradicating the Summer heretics of Dearktir? Or should we simply demand the land, in their weakness they may not be willing to turn down any alliance with us."
 eordand.10.a:0 "Offer a deal for Colltin"
 eordand.10.b:0 "No deal will be made: Colltin is ours!"
 eordand.10.c:0 "What a worthless spot of earth..."
 eordand.11.t:0 "Colltin Purchase - Pelomar offers a deal."
 eordand.11.d:0 "Colltin is a ruined forest beset with rot and hated abominations from continued warfare in previous years between Pelomar and Sidpar. There is one quality that lifts it above worthlessness: the Colltin is the last area of land before entering the forbidden Domandrod. All Peitar feel a deep connection with the Domandrod and the Fey; Sidpar enjoys this connection, but our cousins in Pelomar have been long severed from the Domandrod. Now that our wars have ended and we are now allies, and we realize the pain that we have caused on our cousins, we should consider our ownership of the land. Pelomar offers us acknowledgement of our supremacy over the realms of the south along the Sarmadfar, including support in war against the heretic Caamasi, in exchange for Colltin. Should we accept this offer?"
 eordand.11.a:0 "Their terms are favorable: hopefully they will honor our claims."

All Peitar feel a deep connection with the Domandrod and the Fey; Sidpar enjoys this connection, but our cousins in Pelomar have been long severed from the Domandrod. We considered the Pelomarans as allies and friends after many years of unifying marriage, but they spit on this trust by demanding the Colltin from us! Why ever would we give up our ancestral land, but then again, can we afford to lose their support?"

 eordand.15.d:0 "At last, we are connected to the beating heart of our people, the Domandrod! Sidpar made the wise decision by entrusting us with our rightful land, and most generously asked nothing of us in return!"
 eordand.15.a:0 "A most wise decision on their part."
 eordand.16.t:0 "Colltin Purchase - Demand Refused!"

There are those who suggested that we invite these foreigners to a banquet, hold a traditional autumn feast for them to gauge their intentions. Still, some are more interested in their advanced ships and tools, and suggested that we acquire some of their knowledge. There are even some who suggest that they are a threat to us, and must be dealt with. They turn to you for your decision."

 eordand.18.d:0 "Our explorers have traveled far and wide across Aelantir, discovering lands that would never have been believable before. On a recent expedition, the lands to far west have been discovered past the Broken Isles, inhabited by Ruinborn more advanced than others before. These Ruinborn approached our ships with advanced vessels of their own craft, and hailed our explorer captain to stop and rest at their fine home. The Ruinborn were quickly understood, as our shipboard scholar on Elven language was able to interpret them well enough. Calling themselves the 'Tuathak,' and the land 'Eordand,' they welcomed us to a banquet held in our honour. More alike the familiar elves than the other Ruinborn, we were quick to trust them. How wrong we were. It appears that we must have slighted them somehow, as our food was poisoned, and our ships seized. It is only by my own luck was I able to escape such a place and return to tell of this treachery, m'lord."

 fey_alignment.1.d:0 "One fine day during your daily walk through the private wood, you find a most curious sight: a few bowls and bags overflowing with ripe fruit and golden trinkets. The objects are in two distinct piles, one with gleaming riches and the other with covered, shrouded, secret goods. You spy a small scroll between the two piles, elevated above the muddy ground on a plinth, the paper sumptuous and gilted. Lilting and spidery script decorate the page:\n\n'Dear [Root.Monarch.GetName], \nA fine day to you! We don't forget our friends, and we're truly sorry for what happened last time! So here's a gift for you, no strings attached, we swear! \nGo ahead, open the boxes, you know you want to know what's within! \nShush, I was the one who was supposed to be speaking! Don't listen to them, go ahead and take a few coins, we don't need them!'"

Say, we have a proposal for you. It's not fair that only you should enjoy such delicacies, why don't we throw a grand party for everyone! You wouldn't have to pay a single coin, we'll provide for it! We've got some very special draughts, they'll really rouse them up, and maybe they'll even put a little more gusto in their daily lives!' \n\nAnother nymph speaks up, a rather morose one. 'What they need isn't a cheer-up, they need some gloomy introspection! I'll give them something to be sad about, don't you worry!"

 fey_alignment.3.d:0 "You awake with a chill, afraid of something unknown to you. It is not uncommon to be spooked by the darkness and what might lurk within momentarily before regaining composure, but there is something this night that urges you to caution. Rising from your bed, you reach for a candle and light it. The meagre light helps little, but as you search you notice a shadow that should be illuminated.\n\nA voice calls out to you, cold and distant yet so very close. 'Finally awake. I thought it would be proper to inform you of my actions. Someone must be killed, someone of great value to you. Blood and murder are what drives me, but what really makes it fun is letting someone chose who dies. It's your choice: hand me over a victim, or I'll choose one of my own."

 fey_alignment.5.d:0 "For reasons unknown to you, the Fey that once called you ally and friend are livid with you and are demanding your apology for your grave misdeeds. Ever greedy and possesive for whatever they currently do not have, they demand an exorbitant compensation for your outrageous behaviour. While it might satiate them for an instant, and they might remember this gift for a day or two, the Fey will always shift their opinion of you."
 fey_alignment.5.a:0 "I will do anything, give anything!"

Shame on you, all of you!,' it turns their attention to you. 'You there, servant, introduce me and serve me some drink!'"
 fey_alignment.6.a:0 "And who are you? Be off."

 fey_alignment.8.t:0 "Approval of the Unseelie"
 fey_alignment.8.d:0 "The Unseelie approve of your dedication to savagery and honor. You are henceforth invited to our next hunt, but first a boon of our appreciation.

 fey_alignment.10.t:0 "Something in the Drink..."
 fey_alignment.10.1:0 "The morning after your feast under the willow is pleasant, compared to other hangovers you've had before. You ponder on your life so far, and realize that there's still much more to experience. Who knew true wisdom came from wine?"
 fey_alignment.10.2:0 "You awake the next day with heavy head and uneasy stomach, like a leaden weight weighing on and an earthquake rupturing. You have never felt so sick in your life, every moment agony... must have been the wine."

Even moreso than mortals, the Fey exchange gifts with such glee that would make children look like static and glum. Today you have received an anonymous gift. It is customary that anonymous gifts are to be reciprocated in kind by depositing a gift of your own in the woods: those who deserve it will always receive it."
 fey_alignment.14.a:0 "Thank them for the wonderful gift."

 fey_alignment.15.t:0 "Reciprocation"
 fey_alignment.15.d:0 "You decided to claim the gift for yourself without giving anything in return, going against the ancient rules of conduct. And when rules are broken, those who made them respond gleefully. The Seelie Fey are reminding you of your debt to them, demanding far more than was given to you: the life of your child and heir must be theirs. Or, you could publicly humiliate yourself by admitting your avarice, announcing to all that you are one who can never be trusted and never gives back in return. They cackle at you while you ponder this horrible choice."
 fey_alignment.15.a:0 "I suppose a gift in kind is required..."

 fey_alignment.16.d:0 "The poor and homeless are a constant in every society, every day a struggle for their survival, often only alive because of the kindly donation of those fortunate. While traveling through the capital with your entourage, you pass by another unfortunate soul so alike all the rest, afflicted with the wretched curses of disease and malnutrition. She begs of you for charity of a few coins so she may eat this day, surely not a second thought for one who is decorated with the wealth of a nation. You notice that hidden behind her rags an exquisite amulet that calls out to you; you must have it!"
 fey_alignment.16.a:0 "Give the poor lady some money."

 fey_alignment.17.d:0 "Those who do good deeds are not rewarded in kind, but know that their actions have brought ease to those who need help the most. But today, the good deed you have done will be rewarded, for hidden behind the illusion of a poor beggar was a powerful and dreadful Fey. Your generosity will be rewarded this day with a potion most desired; a Fey Mead that may shield you, once, from the ire of the Fey and their plots. It may only be used once, but you will forever remember that your generosity may one day save your life."

The Silmunas were the Grand Dukes of Dameria joining the Empire of Anbennar, and were the dynasty most frequently on the imperial throne - some even viewed the Silmunas as the only rightful rulers of Anbennar.\n\nThe dynasty was destroyed following the Lilac Wars, when the Grand Duchy of Dameria was dissolved after the victory of the Rose Party and the Silmunas lost their territories save for a Rose-aligned branch in Wesdam.

Under the family, Lorent would become one of the most elvenized realms of Cannor, equaled only by the Grand Duchy of Dameria.\n\nLorent remained independent of the Empire of Anbennar, though eventually a Siloriel managed to be elected to the imperial throne, sparking the Lilac Wars. This would result in a victory for Lorent’s Rose Party, though several duchies under cadet houses in the Bay of Wines would break away from the Kingdom’s control. The House of Siloriel is known for its political acumen, martial traditions, and courtly etiquette."

The King resided within his palace, gorging himself of feasts gathered from Centaur tributes while his warlord vassals ruled their lands unapposed, paying little more than lip service to their liege. When the Centaurs attacked the kingdom suddenly and the king fell in battle, the mighty Ziltagh rose to the throne, leading our people to victory and reaffirming the power of Maghargma over the warlords. While they may still desire their freedom, while Ziltagh rules from his throne none dare to rise against him."

On one hand, their close connections to the lands they rule over allow them to govern them with greater efficiency than we ever could from Maghargma. On the other hand, their loyalty is not guaranteed, as the last few centuries have shown. As we gather the greatest of the clans in the capital to announce their place in the new order of the Empire, we must come to decision as to whom the people should look to as their direct rulers."

Either we hold grand festivals of brawling and bloodsport to find the strongest within a village, granting the victor the right to the land, or we pass the villages to be ruled by prominent families in the area, effectively creating a caste of lower clans. While appointing strong warriors to rule would greatly improve the martial spirit of our people, utilizing local families would grant stability and wealth to the lands they rule over."

They swore fealty to our kingdom in return for protection from the gnolls, and the young prince has grown into a strong and ambitious young man. Today he has approached our officials in the capital with a radical proposal. He notes how difficult the decision to crown a foreign monarch king of Deshak was, and offers himself to be our ruler.\n\nThis is quite a bold request, and accepting it would surely lead to war with our overlords, though it may be our only chance at freedom. Likewise, he seems to have his heart set on this gamble, and we aren't quite sure what he plans to do if we reject him.

He has remained loyal, if vocal about his displeasure of our rule over his adopted kingdom.\n\nToday however, we have received worrying reports that he has petitioned our officials across the sea to crown him king of the Desha, an act that would not only undermine our own rule, but surely drag us into war.

It quickly fades as he remembers those that wronged him and his people, the fiendish gnolls and the spinless Desha, worst of all the opportunistic curs in Eborthil. The only way for the Akani people to truly thrive is under the banner of Khasa."

 akan_flavour.10.t:0 "The Unlikely King"
 akan_flavour.10.d:0 "Incredibly the young prince Bashal has attained victory over the gnolls, reestablishing his powerful kingdom and turning his eyes elsewhere. Namely, towards us, who he sees as rivals and cowards for refusing to support him. Wherever he leads his kingdom, we have a new and fearsome rival in Akan."
 akan_flavour.10.a:0 "How unexpected."
 akan_flavour.11.t:0 "The King of Khasa"
 akan_flavour.11.d:0 "We knew that this would not be a simple feat to accomplish, which makes it all the more gratifying that we have. The banner of Khasa once again flies proudly over the capital, who's inhabitants cheered and roared in jubilation at the return of Prince Bashal. Except today he is no longer a prince, today he becomes a king, destined to be the greatest Akan has ever seen. Khasa had fallen far, but that just means we have further to rise."
 akan_flavour.11.a:0 "This is only the beginning!"
 akan_flavour.12.d:0 "We have received word from Khasa, the young prince Bashal has become a king! In a conflict worthy of legend, he has vanquished the beasts that demolished his kingdom and cruely enslaved his people. Across Akan he is seen as a living legend, the champion of Mother Akan and the future king of all the Akani. Time will only tell what kind of lord he will be."
 akan_flavour.12.a:0 "Good for him!"
 akan_flavour.13.d:0 "We almost couldn't believe the missive when it arrived, however the seal of Khasa is unmistakable. The bold young prince, who arrogantly presented himself in Deshak to sieze the throne, has instead succeeded in reclaiming his kingdom. While much of Akan worships him as a savior and a champion of their goddess, it is clear that Khasa will not go gentle into that good night."
 akan_flavour.13.a:0 "Incredible..."
 akan_flavour.14.d:0 "How. How could a lost prince, banished from his kingdom and raised in the mountains have done this? Across Akan our packmates lie dead or dying, and few that remain are without scars or grievous injury. All of the work of Viakkoc the Mighty, undone in an instant. Much of the pack now looks at us with confusion and hatred, and the future of Viakkoc is all but certain."
 akan_flavour.14.a:0 "How could this have happened?!"

 marlliande.1.a:0 "The current $MONARCHTITLE$ has served us well."
 marlliande.1.b:0 "The Vilaéchi noble."
 marlliande.1.c:0 "The Rósrholych emissary."

 marlliande.2.d:0 "Tonight we grieve the loss of one of our own, the late $MONARCHTITLE$ has met an unexpected fate before their term was completed. The mourning must come later however, for now we must elect our next leader."
