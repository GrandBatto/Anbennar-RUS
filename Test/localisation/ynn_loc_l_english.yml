 ynn_barges.1.t:0 "The Final Journey"
 ynn_barges.1.d:0 "For years, $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has ruled our nation. For good or ill, they have led our people towards tomorrow. Today, however, their journey of leadership has ended, and their journey toward the afterlife, their journey along the sacred Ynn, begins. If this journey is to be successful, however, we must ensure proper transportation, so as to keep our ruler untainted from any impure floating in the River."
 ynn_barges.1.a:0 "Build an opulent barge"
 ynn_barges.1.b:0 "Build an elegant barge"
 ynn_barges.1.c:0 "Build a simple barge"
 ynn_barges.1.e:0 "Just dump them in the River"
 
 ynn_barges.2.t:0 "The Dead Seek Passage"
 ynn_barges.2.d1:0 "The barge of the dead monarch of [From.GetName] has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. If they are to continue their journey down the Ynn, is up to us to decide."
 ynn_barges.2.d2:0 "The barge of our dead monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ has arrived at our Great Ynnic Dam of [Root.GetName]. The inhabitants observe with the due reverence as the barge floats onward, nearing the dam's gates."
 ynn_barges.2.a:0 "Let them pass"
 ynn_barges.2.b:0 "Charge the toll"
 ynn_barges.2.c:0 "Turn them back"
 ynn_barges.2.e:0 "Let our monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.3.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Demands a Toll"
 ynn_barges.3.d:0 "The [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName], holder of the Great Ynnic Dam of [From.GetName], demands a toll from our nation if our monarch is to pass. Though many see this as little more than extortion, if we wish to properly deliver $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ to the Divine Waterfall, we may just have to pay up. However, the option always remains to sink the barge, and have our monarch pass through with the commoners, if need be."
 ynn_barges.3.c:0 "We'll just open up the dam ourselves"
 ynn_barges.3.a:0 "Very well"
 ynn_barges.3.b:0 "Sink the barge"
 
 ynn_barges.4.t:0 "Payment Arrives"
 ynn_barges.4.d:0 "Another barge originating from [From.GetName] has arrived, sailing low in the water, due to its cargo: a massive quantity of coinage. It seems our toll has been payed for."
 ynn_barges.4.a:0 "Let their dead monarch through"
 
 ynn_barges.5.t:0 "No Reply"
 ynn_barges.5.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have sunk their own barge, allowing their monarch to float with the rest of the dead through the Commoner's Gate."
 ynn_barges.5.a:0 "That settles that then"
 
 ynn_barges.6.t:0 "Our Barge Didn't Make It"
 ynn_barges.6.d:0 "With our barge stopped, we have been forced to a last resort: to let our monarch float along the River on their own. Though they run the risk of being tainted by the evil souls who may be floating in the River, at least this way they will make it to the afterlife, for better or worse."
 ynn_barges.6.a:0 "Hopefully they have better luck in the next world"
 
 ynn_barges.7.t:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] Prevents Passage"
 ynn_barges.7.d:0 "It seems that the [From.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.Owner.GetName] has stopped our barge from continuing its holy journey, leaving us with no choice but to sink the barge, and have our ruler run the risk of being tainted. There seems to be nothing we can do, and their ruler appears to have no intention of changing their mind."
 ynn_barges.7.a:0 "[From.Owner.GetName] will pay"
 
 ynn_barges.8.t:0 "Another Monarch Presents Themselves to Us"
 ynn_barges.8.d1:0 "The High Priest of Chrempredpadh will soon receive another barge passing [Root.GetName], carrying the deceased monarch of [From.GetName] as it reaches the end of its holy journey."
 ynn_barges.8.d2:0 "The High Priest of Chrempredpadh will soon receive the barge carrying our deceased monarch $PREVIOUS_MONARCH$ as it reaches the end of its holy journey."
 ynn_barges.8.a:0 "Let it go through"
 ynn_barges.8.b:0 "Prepare a small ritual"
 ynn_barges.8.c:0 "Hold a grand ceremony"

 ynn_barges.9.d:0 "The barge carrying our monarch has reached the end of the Ynn, and, at the Divine Waterfall, our monarch moves on to the next life, pure of any taint of this mortal realm. With their journey ended, a new journey, the journey of [Root.Monarch.GetName], can finally begin."
 ynn_barges.9.a:0 "From yesterday to tomorrow"
 
 ynn_barges.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Forces their Way Through"
 ynn_barges.10.d:0 "Despite our very reasonable request to the new ruler of [From.GetName], they have not sent any funds. Instead, it appears that they have used the ongoing conflict to send troops to seize our dam, and opened up its gate to their barge."
 ynn_barges.10.a:0 "They weren't supposed to do that!"
 
 ynn_barges.11.t:0 "Ynnic Barge Lands"
 ynn_barges.11.d1:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of an ancestor has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into the lake from the Great Waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it we found several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d2:0 "A vessel has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it no occupant was found; rather, it contained several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as a coffin, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.d3:0 "A vessel containing the coffin of a dead Ynnic monarch has arrived in [1031.GetName] today, plunging into its lake from the great waterfall above. The vessel, damaged after the drop, reached the shore, and inside it there are several valuables such as pots, gemstones and clothes, as well as the coffin itself, lined with precious metal."
 ynn_barges.11.a:0 "A tribute from the heavens! Seize it and bury the body"
 ynn_barges.11.b:0 "Loot the contents of the vessel"
 ynn_barges.11.c:0 "Bury these valuables along with the coffin"
 
 ynn_events.0.t:0 "Reurbanization"
 ynn_events.0.d:0 "After centuries of decay, warfare, and abandonment in favour of the countryside, the peace brought about by our nation has allowed the hub cities along the Ynn River to know prosperity once again, reaching levels of urban sprawl unseen since the times of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nWhere once laid ruins and decayed buildings getting scavenged for materials, are now blooming metropolises whose streets draw all from Cannorian fighters to Raheni merchants, and all along the Ynn people are thanking our nation for that."
 ynn_events.0.a:0 "May this be an age of even greater prosperity"
 
 ynn_events.1.t:0 "Athonovie Yrisar"
 ynn_events.1.d:0 "Today, we witness a miracle. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the hubris of its emperors and the short-sightedness of its subjects, who pulled it apart until it was an empire no more. But today that damage is undone, for the Ynn is one, and an Empire again.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been bathed and crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a holy ceremony and, from the height of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] balcony at [Root.Capital.GetName] Castle, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has announced a month of festivity while cheered on by a huge crowd."
 ynn_events.1.a:0 "My beloved subjects... we have to make something special for you"
 
 ynn_events.2.t:0 "Yrisar Rnovo"
 ynn_events.2.d1:0 "Today, we reclaim our birtright. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the decadence of its Sarda emperors and the short-sightedness of its subjects, who forgot the virtues that made it worthy of existing in the first place. But today that damage is undone, for the Ynn is one, and an Empire again.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a solemn ceremony, and invitations were sent out to all knights of the realm for the greatest tourney the Ynn has ever seen."
 ynn_events.2.d2:0 "Today an air of solemnity fills the streets of Malacnar, a somber one for this day spells the end of something, and the beginning of something new. Speaking in front of the largest gathering of warriors the city has ever seen, Battleking [Root.Monarch.GetName] has declared that the warriors of Malacnar will no longer fight just for the banners and glory of the city, but for the entire Ynn River.\n\nThe Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, was brought down by the decadence and weakness of past rulers, and it would be restored by none other than the warriors and generals of Malacnar.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been crowned [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in a solemn ceremony, and many warriors were knighted and assigned fiefs, sure to protect the people of the Ynn River."
 ynn_events.2.a:0 "We won't fail our destiny this time"
 ynn_events.2.b:0 "Perhaps it's the end of an era"
 
 ynn_events.3.t:0 "Irzur Ghnova"
 ynn_events.3.d:0 "Today is a great day. The Ynnic Empire, the greatest nation in the world, has been restored by one of the Rzentur people, so looked down upon by those downstream once. But that is behind us, for we are all part of this restored Ynnic Empire.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] wears the Ynnic crown of the Emperors of old, cheered on by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family and closest companions, and with their shouts they acclaim [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] as the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 ynn_events.3.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]! [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 
 ynn_events.4.t:0 "A New Yrisar"
 ynn_events.4.d:0 "The Ynnic Empire is reborn. Not from the Sarda, not from the Dolindhans, but from us, whose grandfathers settled this river valley a mere generations ago. In that time we embraced the Ynn River Worship, and learned of Ynnic history and its customs, and as our functionaries now purvey all the great monuments that the Empire of old built, nobody in the valley can dispute our succession to the Ynnic Empire."
 ynn_events.4.a:0 "We are ready to claim its legacy"
 
 ynn_events.5.t:0 "The [Root.GovernmentName]'s New Capital?"
 ynn_events.5.desc:0 "With the proclamation of the Empire, multiple proposals have been put forward by our advisors on the question of where a new capital should be, provided we are to move it at all from our current seat."
 ynn_events.5.a:0 "We will retain our current seat in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 ynn_events.5.b:0 "No city is more fitting of an Empire than [1139.GetName]"
 ynn_events.5.c:0 "[1171.GetName] is where it all started"
 ynn_events.5.d:0 "From [1191.GetName] we will watch over all Ynn"
 
# ynn_events.6.t:0 "Rumours from the Nether World"
# ynn_events.6.d:0 "The Netherfolk are a mysterious people who live beneath the enormous cliffs to our south, conducting primitive semi-nomadic lives in a land which is known to us as Posveagal, the Nether World. Contacts with them are scarce, and often limited to the legends and deeds of our oldest forefathers or the recountings from the rare visitor who daringly climbed the Southern Cliffs.\n\nToday [1133.GetName] received one such visitor, an elf named Kalin'do who brought an unusual story: while he and his tribe were out hunting, they saw an enormous vessel approach their shores, and from the vessel descended people dressed like kings, wielding tools and weapons of a quality unmatched."
# ynn_events.6.a:0 "Spread the news to the rest of the Ynn"

 flavor_arverynn.0.t:0 "Dark Times Ahead"
 flavor_arverynn.0.d:0 "While we, of house Vyrekynn, would be the rightful rulers of all the Ynn, our claims are denied as most of the land is held by petty lords who only think of themselves. Recently, we have been defeated by one such warlord, Alaran of Trompolere, who after destroying our army seized our castle of Arvezl then marched on Arverynn. To protect the city, we had to pay him with much of the Imperial coffers, convincing him to conduct his razings and pillagings elsewhere, but we still lost greatly from the war."
 flavor_arverynn.0.a:0 "A price we've had to pay for Arverynn's protection"
 
 flavor_trompolere.0.t:0 "Alaran's Ambition"
 flavor_trompolere.0.d:0 "Our young Lord, Alaran, has triumphed against all odds against the armies of Fadhevych, Arverynn and Stanyrhrada, defeating one foe after another and claiming Arverynn's treasury as his prize. While our borders have more than tripled in size and many of our levies would love to return to their fields, Alaran is far from satisfied, and in this very moment he's marching towards the castle of Vels Bacar, the gateway to the north."
 flavor_trompolere.0.a:0 "Onwards, to Vels Bacar!"
 flavor_trompolere.0.b:0 "Alaran is too dangerous. Dispose of him"
 
 flavor_trompolere.1.t:0 "Trompolere Leader Slain"
 flavor_trompolere.1.d:0 "We have slain lord Alaran of Trompolere! His death without a worthy heir will lead to the undoing of all of his conquests, as already troops from neighbouring lords are marching in to seize back their land he had taken from them."
 flavor_trompolere.1.a:0 "That is the fate of any who would threaten our peace"
 flavor_trompolere.1.b:0 "Seize their land on our border"

 flavor_trompolere.2.t:0 "Trompolere Leader Slain"
 flavor_trompolere.2.d:0 "The upstart warlord Alaran of Trompolere is dead, slain on the battlefield! We will be seizing back our stolen land."
 flavor_trompolere.2.a:0 "Excellent news"
 
 flavor_trompolere.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] Seizes Our Land"
 flavor_trompolere.3.d:0 "Trompolere's warlord has been slain, but our territories have not been returned. Rather, [From.Monarch.GetName], responsible for defeating Trompolere, seized the land for [From.GetName]."
 flavor_trompolere.3.a:0 "That's disappointing"
 
 flavor_trompolere.4.t:0 "Alaran's Death"
 flavor_trompolere.4.d:0 "Lord Alaran has always been brave and defiant in the face of overwhelming odds, however today that proved his undoing, as he charged into [From.GetAdjective] lines where he met his end! With his death the Trompolerey army is left without a clear leadership, and as they hastily march back home, already neighbouring lords are declaring our previous treaties invalid, and sending troops on our borders to take back the land we had conquered from them."
 flavor_trompolere.4.a:0 "A catastrophe!"
 
 flavor_trompolere.5.t:0 "[trompolere_breakaway_target.GetName] Breaks Away"
 flavor_trompolere.5.d:0 "It seems our newly acquired peasants in [trompolere_breakaway_target.GetName] didn't last long, for already they have begun raising the banners of their previous lord."
 flavor_trompolere.5.a:0 "By the Ending Flood!"
 flavor_trompolere.5.b:0 "I was never loyal to Alaran anyway"
 
 flavor_trompolere.7.t:0 "A Liberation?"
 flavor_trompolere.7.d:0 "When news arrived that [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] had slain the warlord of Trompolere on the field of battle and driven off his army, there was much rejoicing. But when the [From.GetAdjective] host marched on our lands, it was clear [Root.GetName] would not gain its independence."
 flavor_trompolere.7.a:0 "We merely gained a new overlord."
