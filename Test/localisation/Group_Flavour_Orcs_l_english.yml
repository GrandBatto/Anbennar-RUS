 orc_flavor.1.t:0 "Ozarm'Chadash - Ruler is challenged"
 orc_flavor.1.d:0 "Ozarm'chadash, 'Duel for Honor' in Orcish, is an ancient and respected Orcish tradition. It is the duel between a clan chief and a member of his clan who considers himself more fit to rule the clan.\n\nIn orcish society, where strength is the key to your social status, duels are not rare. Orcs fight over food, water, property and even partners. Of course, the right to rule the clan can also be contested in such a fashion. That is why the stability of each orc clan relies on the martial abilities of their leader. If he proves himself as one of the best warriors in clan, his rule is relatively peaceful; the tribe may even accept their child as a successor, but only as long as they consider them worthy of their parent's name.\n\nHowever, when a chief shows signs of weakness, mighty and ambitious orcs of the clan will immediately begin to estimate their chances against the current ruler. If they believe their chances are high enough, they will gather the whole tribe and challenge the chief for a duel. When that happens, the chief can either give up the throne, be humiliated and banished from the tribe, or they can accept the fight and try to protect their right to rule. As orcs see it, both outcomes are good for the tribe - if the chief loses, that means that he was a weakling, unfit to rule their clan. And if the chief wins, he proves that he was underestimated and earns the respect and the trust of his tribe.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] received insult with an invitation for a such duel. What will [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] do?"
