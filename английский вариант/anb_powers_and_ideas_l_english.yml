This, however, does not mean they are respected.\n\nStarting in 1620, Eilísin began expanding their policy of mages assisting wine production, through the use of spells, in order to meet the growing demand for Eilísin Tríros, disregarding these well recorded laws of magic. To the despair of the rulers of Eilísin the increased usage of magic did not increased crop yields in the long term, seemingly having the opposite effect.

But Paol was slain during an ambush by soldiers of the Sorcerer-King around Rosefield in the year 998.\n\nThe death of his Knight and close friend sent Maugun into a deep depression, and he deserted. Distraught, and unwilling to return home for the shame of having deserted, he wandered the Rewanwoods aimlessly. During this period he encountered the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen: a Unicorn. With a new purpose in life Maugun set about catching the beast. He stalked the Unicorn for a year before he caught it, and during the process he learned many things about the forest (and killed many invaders that interrupted his quest).\n\nBlessed with his new mount, and a refocused purpose, Maugun returned to his home of High Ording. He found it in flames. Without a moment's hesitation Maugan flew toward the besieged town, barely dodging a fireball thrown his way by a marauding mage. Moving fast so as to avoid a second fireball Maugan sped toward the man, killing him in a single strike. Fortunately, the raiding force was a small one, and with the help of a few volunteers they were easily routed.\n\nIn the following year Maugun fought hard to defend his home. His valiant bravery made him popular with the locals, who coined the name “Maugun the Unicorn Knight”, and he even befriended Rewan Lorentis, the King of Lorent, who created for him the Duchy of Great Ording. In all the centuries since, every Great Ordinger has aspired to his levels of bravery and devotion — and some even believe that if they can fully match him, a unicorn shall appear unto them as well."

Her father spurned him, saying he would need an entire mountain of gems to get a blessing for them to marry. Rubies, to match her hair and inner fire. Nothing else would be good enough for her. Meant to be an impossible task. He suffered many trials. Experienced joy and loss. Searched forgotten caves, fey touched woods, lonely mountains. Until he finally found it, his Ruby Mountain. With permission at long last, he and his beloved married and established a small colony over the mountain of rubies he had discovered. What would one day grow to become Rubyhold.

Human construction methods, how they conduct wars, fashions, how they order their societies; studies have been conducted on these topics and more. For Rubyhold the Institute has been an important way of keeping tabs on what humans are doing, with the added benefit of sometimes uncovering new ideas the dwarves had not considered.\n\nMost famously, it is here that the Lencori Plan was devised: the idea of creating a human nation out of the local tribes to act as a shield against external threats for Rubyhold.

Among the lessons learnt: having an outer set of gates, instead of just relying on the main gates of the hold for protection. These were named the Redgate and the Rivergate. Wrought and rewrought five times in our history in response to new lessons. The gates have stood up against the Ashen Skies, the Dragonswake, and foul sorceries.

Ringed by five lesser rubies, they collectively resemble a stylised rose. As a result, many Cannorians also refer to West Rubies as Rose Rubies.

The discovery of new world gems in the colonies only increased the quantity of gems arriving in Rubyhold for cutting. During the 1600s ruby dwarves began setting up gem cartels, in many cases directly taking over the operation of mines in the new world. With long mining expertise, many countries were eager to accept the assistance of the cartels in their colonies. Those cartels funnelled gems of all shapes and sizes back to Rubyhold.

Every section of wall was covered in banners, with very little space between them or the ground.

This is his tale, as reconstructed by the Chronicler Soréan Silcalas, and recorded in the Imperial Archives at Konwell:\n\nAs with any who would survive the Greatwoods, at a young age he quickly learned forestry and hunting, and became one of the many young men who sought their future among the Alenic Woodsmen. But following some incident (the details are unclear) shortly after he turned 25, he was all-but-exiled from the land of his birth, and he headed east to find better fortunes in the foreign realm called Castanor.\n\nHe found a place tending to Castan V the Great's wolf-hounds, whose lineage ran back to those that had hunted down fey and centaur alongside Castan II Beastbane. Though a lowly kennel assistant, he struck up a friendship with the Castan, whose favourite past-time was hunting with his canine companions, and deeply appreciated their beauty and vigor.\n\nWhen the Castan marched on the Alenic Frontier, seeking to subjugate that unruly people, Clothar accompanied him as assistant and retainer, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Legion II Vertesk. When the wars came to a conclusion, Castan the Great granted him a large swathe of land (including Derwing), elevating him as a 'civilized' and 'domesticated' Alenic.\n\nThe Lord Derwing, Ruler of the Lower Alen under Castanor, would serve well for roughly two decades more, keeping his vassals at bay (though they despised him) and visiting Castanor every year or two to make personal reports to the Castan. But following his death to a bone cancer, much of his land refused to pay his successors any fealty whatsoever — they were denigrated as 'sons of a bitch, the lot of 'em' — and most lands beyond Derwing itself were lost.\n\nThis is our legacy, well-earned by service and never revoked from the family of Derwing. We shall make this truth clear to any and all pretenders."

Some dwarves would accept multiple opponents at once to even the odds, with little change to the outcome.\n\nThe true show only really began when orcs challenged dwarves to the competition.

With this limited success, he went on to update the artillery batteries that Silverforge used, keeping them above the curve in comparison to their neighbors.\n\nStrongbellow would die in 1589 of natural causes and would be remembered in Silverforge for his dedication and ingenuity. In 1652, a university was built and named after him dedicated to Gunsmithing and Metallurgy."

After the war he was ordered to give the lands he occupied with his army back to the Esmarians but he refused, and used his River-Reavers to continue to dominate the riverways of the Esmar against his foes.

This can range from strange and wondrous like the antler-horses of the Ynn and the weeping trees of the Bloodgroves, to the deadly and dangerous, such as the man-eating plants of the Ravenous Isle and the killing winds of the Kaydhano Sea.

Just outfitting for an expedition might cost a hefty chunk of the quest's potential profits, in terms of potions purchased and armor repairs.\n\nBut the ruinborn, ah the ruinborn... They will pay vast sums for shoddy muskets, and give away for almost-free magical reagents that artificers and sorcerers will pay trunks full of crowns for.

Our ranks boast dwarves from every walk of life - no matter your birthplace, clan, or class. As much as the old dwarven clans that have persisted in the surface want to control our adventuring spirit - the reclamation of the Dwarovar somewhat mirrors the expulsion of our kin from the homeland so many years ago: it is a fresh start."

But the first two Fundamental Truths to life is that we all live in One World, and are created by One God, and so Varil did not stop there. By 1631, almost every Busilari ship engaged in the Kingdom's prodigious Sarhaly and Halessi trade would carry with it an array of new inventions along with a missionary who would use them to spread the teachings of the One God. In trading ports across Halann, in the wake of a Busilari trade fleet's visit, small communities of Ravelian adherents would undoubtedly spring up."

By 1441, all 86 packs of the Hillthrone gnolls had been subdued and united under her leadership, through war, diplomacy and marriage, thus becoming the first undisputed Queen-of-the-Hill in recent history.

With the major nobles of House Silcalas in Arbaran having joined the Moon Party, there was a lot of pressure on Kylian to follow suit. However, Kylian being cousins with the King of Lorent meant he held many Rose Party sympathies. This led to a meeting with the King of Lorent by the Rivergate to decide the role of Exwes in the upcoming conflict.\n\nHere, it was decided that it was better for Kylian to stay out of the conflict, to prevent the Silcalas family from installing a pretender. A compromise was reached with the neutrality of Exwes being guaranteed by the Rose Party and Exwes allowing military access to their members. With the Lilac Wars spiralling out of control with no end in sight, all consecutive rulers of Exwes have upheld the treaty to stay out of the conflict. Even after Arbaran switched sides in the Fourth Lilac War, Exwes remained neutral, despite the main reason for neutrality being gone. The wars at this point had proven far more trouble than they were worth."

While seen as a minor title by the rest of the Silcalas dynasty, who had then ruled the Marquisate of Arbaran and now the Empire of Anbennar itself, Alec and Marianne's rule was one marked with tolerance. As a foreign dynasty in Exwes, Alec made sure to be be relatively lax in enforcing Silcalas views on religious and political matters to appease the local population, and become more Exwesser and Arbarani during his rule.\n\nThis lax attitude came to shape Exwes as a nation shortly after the Corinite Proclamation, when many of the disenfranchised came to Exwes to escape the religious conflict regardless of whether they supported Adean or Corin."

The orange glow allowed our forebears to instantly spot the fish in the river, allowing them to survive the winter.

This, and our location near the Small Country and its plentiful produce, made us the number one trade partner for the ever-growing metropolis of Anbenncóst."

Upon finally returning home, she unified the Gerudian tribes of Konungrhavn, Sidaett and Revrhavn against the troll threat that had invaded their lands from the Dalrfjall.

Under Adshaw Dinesck was nothing more than a mere momentary pause for dignitaries journeying to Bayvic. After Gawed turned its hungry eyes north but was solidly rebuffed by Bayvic in fierce fighting, they finally noticed Dinesck, saw the opportunity for a consolation prize, and the city wound up all-but-razed in a sacking by frustrated Gawedi soldiers. Even when goblins rose to power in so-called Bayvek, other Reachmen assumed the same must have happened in Dinesck.\n\nThis is an insult, but also an opportunity.

And when the Reach began to industrialize in the 17th century, the entire Alenic region suddenly hungered for wood to fuel the burgeoning furnaces and proto-factories.\n\nThis was invaluable for Dinesck as it recovered from the Gawedi sack; the city hired out logging teams across the Alen, while devouring more and more of the nearby woods itself. Under the Northern League, Dinesck was instrumental in felling vast swathes of forest fill the Magnates' coffers.

But more importantly, in Dinesck, Tola used the money to build a massive palace just outside the town. But the gentry of Dinesck had long disdained the city's lower classes, and would not relinquish their sneer when one suddenly ascended far beyond their assigned status. For all the palaces' lavish rooms and abundant ballrooms, they ignored any and all of Tola's invitations, not a one stepping foot in his 'Petty Palace'.\n\nTola would live and die in that building, and his fortune enriched two generations of descendants who did the same, before his grandson died without heirs. The Palace became used for two reasons: lumber storage, and impressing visitors who did not know its background.

Eventually, they were given citizenship and granted the right to vote in 1584. Over the years it became more and more common to see a goblin candidate in what was previously a human position, and in 1602, Reb of the Westflowers, an incredibly popular goblin born and bred in Bayvic, was elected to the most high office of Bayvic, or Bayvek as the goblins call it.

Following its conquest by the Gawedi in 1723 the Reachspier gained favour by Gawedi sailors, in no small part thanks to its position on the other side Drowned Giant Isles and the general lack of experience navigating the treacherous seas of the isles within Gawedi fleet. This lead to the Reachspier becoming the unofficial home of the Royal Gawedi navy when operating within the Giant's Grave Sea, who began a restoration effort upon, what they called, "The Pier"."

When the Northern League rose, Frostwall joined it with glee. From its highest building, raised by the ex-Woodsman, Guardman Captain Tomac, it was one of the first in the Reach to fly the League's dark blue flag.\n\nBut the Magnates were greedy creatures, and their factories ever needed more wood to fuel them. Even as the Greatwoods fell to artifice-empowered saws around them Tomac, then Lord-Mayor of Frostwall, refused to let the city's surrounding forests fall.

It has stood alone for centuries against many enemies, fighting near constantly to keep those who would destroy them at bay. This state of near constant war gave rise to an unique culture amongst the dwarven holds, where sacrifice and skill are valued above bloodline, and the good of the hold was held above that of empire.\n\nThe outcasts of the empire gave more for the survival of their hold than any other dwarf in the Empire, be that in the form of gold or the sacrifice of one’s life. This attitude became known as 'The Chain Bond' amongst the people of Krakdhûmvror, a chain between each member of the hold from generation to generation forged in the frozen hardship of the north."

 I02_zaru_ubr_bloth_desc:0 "'Skill over Blood' or 'Zaru ubr Bloth' has long been something of an unofficial motto of the Krakdhûmvroric administration. Due to being founded by exiles and criminals, Krakdhûmvror had very few strong clans at the time of its founding. As such, unlike the rigid hierarchy of the other holds, Krakdhûmvror has held talent in a higher regard than bloodline or clan. As a result, talent is far more likely to rise to the top in the northern hold, and nepotism is considered all but sacrilegious in the frozen halls of power.\n\nThus, Krakdhûmvror has enjoyed an innovative and flexible administration for much of its existence. Many a time a disgraced scion of a royal clan fled to Krakdhûmvror demanding status and position, based on little more than their parentage, and all were told the same thing: 'Zaru ubr Bloth', Skill over Blood."

This is not without purpose; due to its origin as an expanded fort, every building in Krakdhûmvror is first and foremost dedicated to defence and survival. Even the smallest hovel is all but a fortress unto itself. More than once these fortifications stalled invading monsters long enough to save Krakdhûmvror from destruction that befell all other holds in West Serpentspine, leading to a common Quartz Dwarf saying, 'Those in gold houses often end up dead.'"

More akin to Cannorian schools of magic than the runic magic dwarves usually practice, this unique type of cryomancy defies proper classification to any known branch of magic.\n\nThe exact details of Icecraft are a closely guarded secret, but it is known that the hold's namesake Frozen Forges channel the biting cold of the northern winds into a magical energy that allows the hold's Ice-Smiths to create Ice-Steel, an extremely versatile metal imbued with the characteristics of ice and freezing water. From weapons that give enemies iceburns from close contact and arrows that shatter on impact to create shrapnel, to armour that can 'unfreeze' and flow back together to recover from any minor damage, the potential applications of Ice-Steel are widespread.\n\nWhile the hold's signature steel's production has over the centuries declined to a point where it has become a prestige symbol, Ice-Steel armaments are nonetheless common enough that well-off soldiers have at least one weapon or piece of armour made of it, making the Frozenforge Hall's armies a glacial wall of unbending steel and death."

Originally built to protect Dwarovar against the Ice Giants of yore and manned by exiles and criminals banished from the rest of Dwarovar, it became a derelict outpost after the giants' civilisation fell thousands of years ago. As the last outpost of Aul-Dwarov, isolated in the Giants Anvil mountains and disconnected from the Dwarovrod network, only people who arrived to make a new live for themselves in the hold were those unwanted elsewhere in Dwarovar or those trying to escape their past, leading to the outpost developing reputation a solitary culture, and having very little interaction with the outside world.\n\nAt least, until the emergence of the orcs. As the holds of Western Serpentspine fell, refugees began to pour to the fort from Amldihr, Orlazam-az-dihr, and Dûr-Vazhatun, desperate for safety from the orcish menace. The rapid expansion of the hold's population forced the dwarves to work with what little resources they had to expand the fortress' defences, living quarters and infrastructure to accommodate a vastly larger population, in a relatively short period of time. While this event took place ages ago, the dwarves of the Frozen Hold of Krakdhûmvror still retain the lessons of those days to this day, allowing them to easily integrate foreigners and expand the hold's infrastructure to account for the needs of the people."

It takes the most tenacious and determined people to work together in order to survive in as unforgiving environment as Giant's Anvil, and centuries of hardships and struggle for survival have led to the dwarves of Krakdhûmvror becoming as unyielding as the quartz they get their name from. No matter what they might be up against, the Quartz Dwarves will face the odds with grizzled determination."

Because of our reputation for fair deals, these so-called 'early payments' became commonplace, and were often overseen by Belgar, who got a small cut.

Thorin Goblinslayer, the commander of our army, was sent into such a rage upon hearing the news that he immediately sent the army on a forced march north through the caverns. Arriving in Mithradhûm in a record three days, Thorin then whipped the troops into a great fury and ordered an assault against the unprepared Orldhûmic army, killing over half the enemy.

When he passed from this world, his students took his lessons to heart, and eventually our military culture came to embody Thorin's ideals.

While the meltwater from the peaks that has long fed the pipes of Jorkad was long sufficient to maintain us, the supply had nearly become insufficient.

This led to a revolution in technology for the hold, and by the 1900s, would create weapons of mass destruction."

However, as our critics so often fail to see, those who willfully embrace our truth are treated with the utmost respect and care; these state wards are afforded a status far in excess to what they would receive otherwise.\n\nOurs is a truly enlightened empire, for we are the only ones who govern according to a transcendental principle - the need to herald the return of our good to bring about the cleansing of this world."

Many of the peoples who borders the Deepwoods still have folk stories warning children that if they misbehave then the fey-folk will steal them away in their sleep.

His clan sacked Bladekeep and the dreadful howls they performed during the pillage had given them their name. The Blackmoon Clan on the other side was famous for their battle shamans, who unleashed their magical power on the armies of humans and dwarves. The Silentblade Clan was considered somewhat dishonorable by other orcs, but they excelled in guerrilla combat, using ambushes to defeat their foes.

All these gifts were given to help orcs crush the human and orc realms in Cannor and plant a new Deepwoods in their place.

With their backs to the cliffs it was clear to the Boek that there would be no surrender, and they fought with a previously unseen ferocity. The Braves, living up to their name, charged, with disregard for their own lives, headlong into the Cannorian muskets. Refusing to give up what little they had left the Braves pushed on through the gunfire, with each Brave taking as many as 6 shots to bring down.\n\nBut it was not enough; no amount of bravery could make up for the technological disparity between the settlers and the Boek and they were slaughtered to the last.\n\nIn the end it seems the Lenef were proven correct: there is more to war than mere bravery.“ – Excerpt from The Last Stand of the Braves."

Soon, though, our scouts found the source of this great terror. Strange folk so much like ourselves, yet so different. They cut down our scouts with the same emotionless precision as they offered the Bloodfeeders.\n\nSo it was for years, that we skirmished with these 'elves'. Though we could scarcely capture them, for the ferocity they offered, what little we could gleam was that they wished to kill all who walk upon the world, save for their own kin. So it was, for a time, our dwellings pushed from the forest that was our home, our trees aflame as we found ourselves set against this great enemy.\n\nBut we were not alone in our fight. A strange short-eared folk followed who too came from across the seas but were embroiled in battle with the elves. Whilst at first we had distrusted these people it became clear we could not stand alone and our braves joined with theirs becoming their brothers in battle, standing at our side, along with many others. It was not short, it was not simple, but soon enough, we had pushed the callous elves of this Aelnar into the sea once more."

Furthermore many members of our tribe have been found alive but with two puncture marks on their neck, but with no memory of the night before.\n\nA thorough investigation by our priests and braves lead us to the answer to this mystery. With the settlers came a new breed of Bloodfeeder, one capable of disguising itself as a person, tricking our people into following them away from the tribe where they are drained of blood.\n\nOur braves have become adept at hunting and killing these creatures. Unlike their Bloodfeeder brethren they are vulnerable to sunlight and bound to a single location that, once destroyed, can eliminate the creature permanently. This skill seems to be one that is in high demand with the settlers and our braves are often hired to hunt down and kill these creatures."

 G42_unite_the_boek_desc:0 "It is said that many years ago warriors came from the heavens to unify the warrior tribes of the Boek. We are the descendants of these warriors, and our lands are the results of their conquests as is proven by our most sacred artifact, a solid gold medallion with an embedded blue jewel, representing the river our tribe was to settle along, and which still brings us our tribute from the heavens. We must expand our tribe and unite the Boek; as is our destiny."

 G42_kuukus_wlaws_desc:0 "While our destiny is shaped by the heavens our people are shaped by something darker, something older, something hidden reaching out from the depths and into the minds of the Inek: the Kuukuswlaws, the speaker in the water.\n\nThe Kuukuswlaws whispers of things no man should know. It whispers of the world as it is, not as you know it but the strange and incomprehensible truth of it all.	 It whispers of the world as it was, a time before time when the world was water, and the water was the world. And then, it whispers of you. Your deepest desires, those we hide even from ourselves, and how they can all come to bear. And the whispers, they drag you down. Down to the bay where the waters beckon you. Down under the chilly surface of the water and to the depths. Down into the embrace of the Kuukuswlaws and once the Kuukuswlaws embraces you, you never return."

 G42_draining_the_invaders_desc:0 "In the year 1523 the invaders came from the sea. While we did not know from where they had come, we knew why. They meant to steal from us, from the moment they saw our tribe, adorned with the riches granted to us by the heavens, there was jealousy in their eyes, and we knew they would return, to push out of our homeland and claim what is rightfully ours.\n\nThey returned not long after, bringing with them a host armed with great weapons that far outmatched our own, but they believed their weapons made them invincible, and they did not know the land as we do. A small force of our Braves awaited them, weapons at the ready. They marched to face us, and found themselves sinking, having walked into a concealed bog. But they pressed on, towards the mound where our warrior awaited them, their fate sealed.\n\nThe signal was given.\n\nOur warriors arose from the depths where they had concealed themselves. The invaders were outnumbered with 10 of our warriors to each of their own. Surrounded and outnumbered the invaders were helpless and we slaughtered them to the last man."
 G42_world_above_the_cliffs:0 "World Above the Cliffs"
 G42_world_above_the_cliffs_desc:0 "In our ancient legends there is a tale of the brave few Inek who climbed the great cliffs, ascending to the world beyond where the people there bestowed upon them great gifts of gold, in exchange for the face of one of our gods. Inspired by this legend, and aided by a foreigner named Adrien síl Terr, a group of Braves from our tribe gathered to make the fabled journey once more, seeking to learn about the people who live there and gain their aid in expanding our tribe.\n\nAt first it seemed they feared us, believing us to be some form of demons, and were cautious with their words, telling us little of their tribe and the other tribes of the river. That changed when we told them of the vast ocean beyond the cliffs astonished they lead our expedition to the local chief Seronval asking endless questions about the bay and yet strangely disregarding our warnings.\n\nUpon our arrival their chief granted our tribe many gifts, most notable of all was the necklace granted to Tewalari, our chief, before his departure, and its striking resemblance to the artifact granted to us by the heavens. Tewalari saw this sign and, realizing that these people were also working in service of the heavens, promised to return to them thus becoming Tewalari Doboni-Achukkoa, Tewalari the Divine Passageway."

 G42_ynnsmouth_settlement:0 "Ynnsmouth Settlement"
 G42_ynnsmouth_settlement_desc:0 "Whilst the Inek had nominally settled Ynnsmouth, the settlement was never a large one, likely due to the Inek’s fear of the seas, and the Kuukuswlaws lurking in the bay. The Cannorians had no such fears and were more than happy to settle along the coast, however none settled Ynnsmouth, likely due to both the Inek Braves who would attack any colonists and a deeper, instinctive, feeling that Ynnsmouth should be avoided.\n\nThe first permanent Cannorian settlement in Ynnsmouth was founded as late as 1673 by a small group of settlers from Busilar, having fled the country due to conflicts over the continued worship of certain Regent Court deities by the populace. Following the foundation of this settlement the Inek found themselves drawn towards the coast, expanding the Inek settlement and eventually absorbing the Busilari settlement. Ynnsmouth grew to become a major trading hub due its prime position at the mouth of the Ynn. Most traders do not stay for long."

Many attempts to unify the region have happened in the past, but the deadly Kaydhano sandstorm would periodically kill those caught in its winds and destroy much infrastructure outside of the cities making effective communication impossible.

Facing this, our predecessors turned to beyond the Cleaved Sea and there founded settlements that would not be touched by the storms.

A true degabhen will dedicate most of his life towards perfecting the art of warfare and when called to battle will fend off armies much larger than theirs, as their ancestors did during the League War several centuries ago."
 G46_efficient_recruitment:0 "The Daografí"
 G46_efficient_recruitment_desc:0 "Due to its harsh requirements, in its infancy our army would often find itself unable to conscript an acceptable number of warriors. It was thus necessary that we created a strict and efficient governmental body, the Daografí, that would make sure that every possible warrior had been accounted for. Even as our nation expands, and more and more people are counted as citizens, our institution must remain as efficient as ever. Every man that can serve, will serve."

This was possible thanks to the great general Eranian, the man in charge of our expedition towards the new lands. He was a true visionary, and taught the men under him to not only fight, but also build. We should extend Eranian’s lessons to all citizens so that, when idle, our warriors will still help further our state by assisting the construction of important buildings."

All kheions but one that is.\n\nIn Lokemeion the first Scholar King, Finorius the Wise, came to power and promoted the ideal of internal peace, for if we were unable to find peace inside our walls, it stood to reason that we would be unable to keep the peace when we could finally go outside."

But to ensure this practice works out, we will need an ample diplomatic corps that can smooth over any issues that might arise.

 G51_memories_of_the_league_war_desc:0 "Over a thousand years ago, the kheions fought a great war between two leagues, the Kherkan League and the Degabhen League. Isolated from our southern allies, it was presumed by most that our nation would quickly buckle under pressure from Oktikheion and Degakheion, however, contrary to expectations, we held our ground against our foes and eventually completely stopped their advance. This was thanks to a series of fortifications that our citizens had decided to erect just a few years prior to the conflict.

Whoever holds this citadel controls the passes between the mountains and the desert, and can easily prevent an enemy from attempting to march around the western flank of the arid plains of Marutha and into the hills of Rakhadesh. It is for this reason that Bubhagama has come to be called 'The Portcullis of the Marutha', and our custodianship of this vital chokepoint has led us to specialize in defensive tactics that ensure the might of our bastion in the Northwest."

That changed when Mahipalar of the Flower Oath ascended the throne, his brilliance and personal zeal for good government calling back to the legendary leadership of the philosopher-kings of old. Under his watch, Babhagama came to flourish despite the lack of wealth or resources in the region, his careful planning and watchful eye correcting all inefficiencies. The success of this administrative focus on centralized planning subsequently began a long tradition of excellent administration in Babhaghama."

Our lands were some of the first where the refugees of Grôzumdihr fled to after its fall, and a large community of these dwarves continues to live in Babhagama to this day, serving our community as excellent statesmen and advisors."

 R06_chakrams_of_bubhagapur_desc:0 "The chakram, a circular throwing disk with a sharpened outer edge, is a particularly common weapon among the folk of Bubhagapur. In battle the weapon is twirled on the index finger of an upraised hand and thrown with a timed flick of the wrist - this technique can easily propel a chakram several hundred feet with deadly accuracy. Though training to use the Chakram is difficult, its unusual mechanics make it useable by both infantry and cavalry and makes our forces effective at inflicting great casualties on the enemy before we engage in close combat. As its use spreads among our soldiers, the chakram promises great utility and has become a symbol of our martial prowess."

Recent military and diplomatic successes have led to more direct integration of the Ghankedheni into our growing realm, however, and the invaluable knowledge of ambushes and positioning that these warriors bring to our officer corps will certainly be of great help in the future."

When our government arrived, we brought a third language with us - Sarniryabsadi, the tongue of the South and the Ascension Peninsula, birthplace of the harimari.\n\nWhile some governments would attempt to impose the language of the ruling class onto their subjects, we see clearly the folly of attempting to force a new language on a linguistically divided region. Instead, we will conduct official business in all three tongues of Babhagama, fostering goodwill among our diverse subjects and allowing us to more easily manage the myriad peoples present in our holdings."

Only strength will save her, the strength of unity and wisdom, and that is a strength Babhagma has. At this time of crisis we are reminded of the poetic works of the great Harimari poet and former Senapti of Babhagama, Kobidran. Among his most famous works, the poem that would become known as The Flower Oath began 'On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange fragrance in the south wind. That vague sweetness made my heart ache with longing and it seemed to me that is was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.'\n\nMany see a message of a changing season where destined conclusions come to pass in these words, and find them deeply relevant to modern times. We agree - and we will embody this longing, ambition, and surety as we reaffirm the oath that gave our ruling dynasty its name. Under our firm paw we will bring the peace and serenity of the lotus blossom to Rahen by any means necessary."

Tiltaghar has been the seat of petty kings and great priests in Shamakhad for thousands of years, most recently being occupied as the seat of one of the Dhenijanraj's eight senapti.

Though it has fallen into disrepair in recent years due to the conflict raging in northern Rahen, the Sojourner's Road and Tilathi remain sacred places of great beauty worthy of restoration and protection.

 R08_caste_without_prejudice_desc:0 "Once, Harimar's grandson Manava passed the Edict of Sardiphadin to restructure the ancient Raheni caste system with harimari at the top and humans beneath them. While this decree was unquestioned by many in South Rahen, in Tiltaghar the distance from the centers of political gravity meant that the reform never took as firm of a hold. Throughout the history of the Northern Senapti, humans proved their valor, skill, and intelligence, and the attitudes of the harimari rulers of Tiltaghar changed to become far more accepting of working with, instead of ruling over, humans over the years. This culminated in the 1601 Edict of Tiltaghar, issued shortly after the collapse of the Dhenijanraj's central authority, and decreed that the highest castes would no longer be forbidden to humans, who would henceforth be equal partners in the land of the Tiger Ziggurat."

At the height of his influence, Manava was the power behind the throne of the Raja - and some claimed that it was he who truly ruled over the whole of the Raj.

Despite our internal diplomatic struggles, the Radiant Sun is also strong in the great mercantile republic of Bhuvauri to the East, and we have cultivated many commercial contacts there.\n\nTheir mercantile bent and knack for a good deal has rubbed off on many of those merchants who have regular contact with the slave-princes, and we find our traders growing more skilled by the day. By encouraging widespread adoption of Bhuvauri techniques and methodologies concerning the flow of trade we may be able to leverage our improved economic situation to overcome our isolated diplomacy."

 R52_treason_of_ghamakrit_desc:0 "When a force of forty thousand Jaddari zealots crossed into Rahen and aimed at Dhenijansar, we rallied to the Raja's banners as we had always done since days of old. But our adherence to the Radiant Sun school of High Philosophy had made the message of the Jadd particularly compelling to our Senapti and many of our warriors, and the ever-ambitious lords of Rabhidaraj sensed an opportunity. Secret talks were initiated with the Jaddari, via Bhuvauri liaisons, to betray the Raja and join our realm to theirs - in return, we would convert to the Jadd and join them as equal partners in empire.\n\nWhen the forces of the Dhenijanraj met the Jaddari at the Battle of Ghamakrit, the Rabhidaraji held the right flank as always - but at a critical moment in the battle, we withdrew and exposed the Raja's center, allowing them to be crushed by the Jaddari cavalry. With the army broken, we marched alongside the Jaddari to the gates of Dhenijansar and threw down the walls for our new brothers in the faith. Thus, by the treason of Rabhidaraj did the Jaddari gain their dominance over lower Rahen - and we obtained our central place as governors and administrators in their growing realm, sculpting policy from within as willing partners instead of subjugated serfs."

Though the harimari have long had a strong traditionalist bent and have been slow to adopt technological innovations, Rabhidaraj's religious conversion has led us to see the light in more ways than one. The ideas that travel down the Golden Highway, that come ashore at Sramaya, will not stop just because we wish them to. No, let us recognize the value of these new ideas, the value inherent in adaptability, and propagate these new innovations through the territories under their control."

From our position in central Rahen we could rapidly seize strategic points, and our long partnership with the Jaddari had ensured that we retained a well trained personal military force and were skilled administrators who could dominate Dhenijanraj and the lands that surround it. Because of this, in the months and years that would follow the fall of the Jadd Empire, Rabhidaraj would establish itself as a power player in the emerging Deioderan polities that would dominate Rahen for the next half-century."

This led to several vast construction projects throughout the region, as old walls were demolished, and new ones were constructed several dozen attilambi away.

To drive out their oppressors, the towns formed makeshift militias of common citizenry. Initially, they faced several defeats and were too weak to accomplish their goal. Only when the dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr came to their aid could the deadlock be broken. But just as the tide had turned, the goblin invasions began in 1423.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the untrained militia fought many desperate battles, winning some and losing many. Some territory was lost, but Crathánor prevailed, its militias becoming scarred veterans baptized by war. Those who survived would later train a new generation of capable and aggressive militia."

The dwarven engineers provided much valuable knowledge to Crathánori shipbuilders, and after the secession war dwarven-style heavily armoured ships became the standard.

Crathánor would prosper greatly as a result and reach the zenith of its power.\n\nBut eventually, the sun must set, as the day cannot last forever. So too did Crathánor's independence come to an inevitable end in 1658. In the dark years that followed, the Crathánori patiently waited for the sun to rise again."

It was originally tasked with guarding the eastern border of the Kingdom of Dameria. Its knights were renowned lancers and participated in many tourneys and battles throughout the centuries, their fearsome charges shattering lines of infantry with ease.\n\nEver since the formation of Anbennar, the Order's status and importance diminished. The long years of peace in Anbennar meant that fewer and fewer knights joined it. Yet the Order served Dameria faithfully until the Lilac Wars. During that conflict, Vincen II síl Cestir, the Duke of Cestirande and Grandmaster of the Order, declared independence from Dameria and joined the Rose Party. In 1444 Lilac Wars were over and the Order was on the winning side, but only thanks to their betrayal of Dameria."

And lastly, they were among the fiercest supporters of the House of Silmuna, but nevertheless sided with the Rose Party in the Fourth Lilac War. This pragmatic yet dishonourable behaviour earned them few friends but many territories. Unfortunately, it did not result in the prettiest of borders."

Perhaps the most infamous such insult was recorded during the Battle of the Moon Council, when Duke Vincen II síl Cestir called Adénn "Skylance" Silmuna "Brokenlance of the Waning Moon".

But opposing them were the Vernmen of Galeinn, who shared their ambition. This rivalry lasted for countless years and showed no signs of stopping after the Lilac Wars. If anything, it became increasingly intense as the two countries battled for dominance over the river. Later on other countries got involved, yet Cestirande stubbornly fought on."
 A98_workhorses:0 "Cestirander Universal Horse"
 A98_workhorses_desc:0 "While Cestirande was a small and relatively insignificant realm, its unique horse breed was rather well known in Cannor. The Cestirander breed was versatile, sharing traits of both cold-blooded and warm-blooded horses. The Knights of the Long Lance rode on them during tourneys and battles while farmers used them as work horses. As the importance of cavalry on the battlefield diminished, the latter role would become increasingly important, and the horses were crossbred with cold-blooded ones to make them better draft animals. The Cestirander horses would become the engine of local production, plowing fields and hauling freight."

 A98_knights_of_pen_desc:0 "By fighting eagerly for the Duchy of Cestirande, the knights of the Long Lance had perhaps hoped for some surge in relevancy. Yet they continued to diminish as technology developed and made lancers obsolete. Members of the order became little more than titleholders or low-ranking officers in the army.\n\nEventually, however, the Order did have its resurgence. The Dukes and Duchesses of Cestirande began to grant the title of knight to court officials and bureaucrats as a reward for exemplary service. This new generation of knights did not wield the lance, but the pen. The burgeoning paper industry of the Duchy's capital, Cestaire, grew to primarily fuel these new knights and their numerous writings."

Its Dukes and Duchesses used this bureaucratic machine to exert power over their subjects, dissolving the power of the nobility and the clergy. Their power was absolute, and only an outside force could bring an end to their rule.\n\nAfter the unification of the Empire of Anbennar, many Cestiranders would work in the administration of the huge nation, becoming vital cogs of the sprawling bureaucratic machine."

Years later, the Roilsardi defied their Lencori cousins and restored the Duchy anew after reclaiming its former lands. The Crown was remade and is now once again worn by the ruler of Roilsard.

After the Crusade was over and the Pestilence had been eradicated, some Roilsardi crusaders returned home, but many chose to stay and join their cousins, finally helping supplant the suppressed Milcori tribes that inhabited The Borders.

It was often served with traditional roasted foods which were popular among the Roilsardi.

They were called Glassweavers due to their skill of using magic to create elaborate items from glass, so beautiful and intricate that they were famed well beyond Bisan itself.\n\nWhile the Wexonards do show a colder reception to the elven race, the Counts of Bisan have generally allowed them great autonomy and benefits - either due to Bisan's pro-Damerian leanings, or perhaps coin that fills their coffers."

Many know of The Necropolis that dominates the city, which was, for a longest time, the largest temple of Nerat's faith until the Bone Citadel in Aelantir, but only historians know that Nerat was not a god of a pre-Elikhet Kheterata, but was in fact an death god imported by Milcorissian slaves.

The Bisanese solved the problem like how they usually did, with violence. In the night of 7th of Nerament 1576, the eve of Lansday, the Corinite faithful struck at the Adeanic nobility.

The Marrhold militia was able to cross through secret tunnels while the capital was being sieged, and by morning the Blademarcher king found himself cut off from his supply line and surrounded on both sides. The subsequent surrender of the Blademarches shocked all of Cannor, and Marrhold gained immense prestige as a nation 'nigh impossible to siege'.

In the Lupulan, to have power is to be a king, and as such almost all people claim the royal title of King (or Hari, after the Harimari, no doubt) - nobles and powerful tribes are not a thing in the Lupulan Rainforest, only kings, lesser kings and their families and subjects. However, despite their many differences and dynastic grudges comes a great fervour repelling any foreigner who might try to call their royal lands home."

In time, they would take what they had learned and made their own home-grown lumber companies, and on these deforested lands rose the first towns and cities of Yanglam make. After all, if the rainforest is to be destroyed for progress, we might as well be the ones to do it, right?"

Named the 'Farlands', the Bomdan and Raheni peoples had long dismissed Thidinkai as an endless land with a savage and aggressive people - but Harimar saw this as an untapped land full of High Temples to uncover and learn from, after all, what were they fighting so fiercely to protect.\n\nThe answer was nothing. Harimar returned home embarrassed for amassing such a great host. They defeated any army they came across, and stole what meagre riches the land had. But there was only a handful of temples, and none holding great importance.

To charge downhill, through fire and flame, and to clash with a foe that outnumbered you ten to one, was to be the last act of bravery... but Castellos saw otherwise. And during the Castanite charge, what did Castellos do? He appeared in the form of a Silver Dragon and blew the demonflame back at the gnolls, decisively altering the fate of mankind!\n\n'Men of Castanor, be bold, for your arms will not fail you!

And then came down the sky what looked like a lighting, followed by a deafening but oddly musical roar of thunder. The Silver Dragon of Castanor, the legendary Avatar of Castellos, who helped Castan I at Burning Hill, was coming to our help again - and began to fight with Zaamalot. I knelt before the glistening silhouette instinctively, amazed at the creature's might and beauty. For once, the sight of dragonfire filled me with hope, and the flames reflected on his scales, shining so brightly that it seemed dawn had come for a moment. Two years after the end of the Dragonwake, I still feel blessed by this memory.

Hence, when Castanor was rebuilt from its ashes, it was clear to all that the new Castan lacked a fitting crown. From today on, this will not be the case.\n\nOut of silver and mithril, in one year of work, our best smiths forged a huge majestic crown. At the base, shining brightly, is a circlet sculpted to depict the White Walls. Surmounting each tower of the circlet are statues of the gods of the Cannorian Pantheon, encrusted with innumerable jewels. At the center, linked to the interior of the wall by bands of metal, lies an astonishingly accurate representation of Trialmount, topped with a huge diamond! But that is not all, as there are actually two different parts in this masterpiece! Our smiths forged a splendid miniature dragon, and the most talented enchanter of our realm created an invisible magic link between the two parts, so that the dragon can levitate atop the crown! The mighty Silver Dragon of Castanor deploying its wings around Castan's head as he speaks is truly a sight to behold."

Many of the cities were sacked amidst the "Typhoon of Broken Vases," as the infamous event became known, but not Semphrerong — it just happened that the city was between contracts, for the first time in centuries. It was manning its walls with a smattering of other mercenaries, and so was passed over amidst the chaos."

But King Levodas didn't weep, and fought on, slaying the three champions one by one and avenging his companions.

To this, a companion of the slain King rallied the warriors yet again, saying “When the last Malacnari is slain, then you will rule Malacnar.”, and once he was slain his next best companion rose to revolt, and so on and so forth...

Only after the barycenter of the Empire had shifted south to the lands of the Sarda, did they break free along the rest of Dolindha.

We will tear down the old Bostynn Bridge, and, using the most lavish materials our coffers can import as well as advice from Cannorian engineers, we will build a new splendid bridge that will signal a new start for the town, and help revitalize the local economy."

 G25_bostynn_bridgewardens_desc:0 "This has to be said - the whole reason the Bosancovac Dam was built, was because two Imperial functionaries had been thrown off the Bostynn bridge, then the city refused to apologize for the incident! In a stark contrast to us, Bostynn has always been the home of fierce, outright obstinate people, who jumped at every opportunity to revolt, forming impromptu bands of peasant warriors who ransacked the countryside until the Imperial army would inevitably arrive to put them down.\n\nThe "Bridge-Wardens" were experienced hunters who frequently put themselves at the head of those revolts and, when not busy leading, constituted the best archers available north of Arverynn.

While nobody contests that Stantirshalan produce is of far higher quality, it would be foolish to let ourselves fall behind in quantity: we shall invite some Cannorian farmers as honourary guests to our harvest festivals, where, under the effect of the beer - and the sense of commonality brought by our festivities - it'll be easy for them to open up and share the secrets of their craft."

The modern town of Brelar itself originates from a village built around a water-powered lumber mill, but of course no mere watermill can compare to the Great Ynnic Dams, built by master engineers of old who tragically lost their lives during the collapse of the Ynnic Empire.\n\nFortunately for us, some of them were miraculously escorted to safety here in Brelar, where their descendants live to this day, and it is with their help that we will complete our newest project: we will upgrade Brelar's watermill, to be made huge and out of gold, bringing prestige and respect to what is the symbol of our nation, as well as a crucial source of energy."

While the empire would erupt into a civil war between Sarda and Dolindhans fifty years later in 896 and begin its slow decline, none could say that it was Brelar's fault."

When King Jeborad crossed the Ynn at Vels Bacar to conquer southward, he did so coming to the aid of his allies in Stanyrhrada.

And while other knights may mock this relatively placid lifestyle, isn’t peace what all true warriors strive for?\n\nIn 1721, at the Battle of Delanydon Crossing, the Knights Oathkeeper finally took up arms yet again - but not the arms everyone expected, for they began unleashing deadly volleys of pistol fire upon the enemy lines before their charge, in a devastating combination of Tellumtiri gunmanship and Ynnic chivalry."

Vels Bacar was built in their honour at the middle point of their voyage, and two giant statues bearing their likeness were constructed, one on each side of the Ynn River.\n\nWhen King Jeborad of Vareynn declared war on the Principality of Vels Bacar in 560, he had his soldiers deface the statue of Filenval-on-the-Northern-Side, cutting off his head and having it be replaced by a replica of his own face. After the war was over, Jeborad mockingly told the Bacarans “Find the head, and you can put it back.”. Bacaran citizens spent two centuries looking for the missing head, until it was finally found to have floated past Adbrabohvi and the Divine Waterfall, ending in the Nether World where a tribe of Boek had taken to worshipping it. Emperor Calasandor yen Brelar graciously paid for its return, while Jeborad's head was brought to Vareynn. “It was destiny” the Emperor commented “That the head of a great explorer would see the world beyond the Ynn River.”\n\nThe statues of Filenval and Filenval stand next to the dam to this day, sending off all the dead who float down the Ynn River."

And as they argued, the Bacaran allies, the Amstenuri, lost a battle they had to fight on their own and found themselves besieged.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, Bacaran sentries kept watch and made fortifications over the fords of Arverynn while their main force engaged the Stanyrhradans, seeing some successes. It was all for nothing when, in 572, Jeborad took the city of Vels Bacar by the storm using a path nobody had foreseen: a massive pontoon bridge had been built in just seven days from one statue of Filenval to the other, and, with the cover of the mist that in rainier days makes it impossible to see the other side of the Ynn, nobody in Vels Bacar noticed Vareynn's soldiers and riders atop their massive antler horses suddenly charging in before it was too late.\n\nThe lesson our marshals have drawn from all this is thus: “Time is of essence.”"

And while the first elections were held successfully to the cheer of the people, this move was deeply unpopular with many Sarda neighbours, who called the new republic an anachronism and a betrayal of Ynnic values in favour of Cannorization. Thus began the War of the Bacaran Succession, where Lord Calrodiy V of Arverynn pressed the claim of a vassal of his to rule Vels Bacar.\n\nThe war soon escalated, involving not only Sarda, but also many frontiermen nations and even the Mayor of Valorpoint and the Gospodh of the Rzentur. In the final stages of the war, kobold snipers were picking off Escanni knights and dwarven cannons mercilessly bombarded the walls of Vels Bacar, as other dwarves on the Bacaran side rebuilt them each day and night. The war lasted for 21 years and saw Vels Bacar besieged five times, ending only after the death of a million people and Vels Bacar's destruction. Afterwards, Vels Bacar stopped existing as a city, and its name was only used to refer to the nearby dam."

One such example of the latter was the poet Talvyr, who fell out of grace with Emperor Calrodiy I after jokingly calling him "the Battleking of the Ynnics".\n\nBanished to Vels Fadhecai, Talvyr became an open dissident to Calrodiy's regime, writing poems that questioned the utility of war while in his verses he likened soldiers to brutes and knights to thugs. However, when a band of Epednar riders approached the town he was living in and he saw the local guards stand up for his protection, the seed of change was planted in Talvyr, and a year later he wrote his most famous book, "To the Garrisons".\n\nVels Fadhecai has seen many people arrive, from all walks of life and believing in radically different things. They all went through a similar story, a story where different people align together, and each contribute with their uniqueness, their individuality, in the face of a common threat."

From the earliest age she showed great magical propensity, being able to conjure water bubbles and even water bombs she would hit her guardians with. When the War of the Bacaran succession erupted in 1602, Mitrenya was already a consummate war veteran, having led incursions into the Epednar territories over the past two decades, going as far as to reach the recently-founded city of Pelodaire during one of them.\n\nIt was thus to everyone's surprise when she announced she would maintain her neutrality during the Bacaran conflict.\n\nTwenty years later, when the war was over, a shocking discovery was made: Mitrenya had been torturing the prisoners made during her past incursions, as well as some of her subjects and even relatives of her vassals. Not satisfied with water magic anymore, she would finish torturing them only to kill them then bathe in their blood; drawing power from it, using it to strengthen her magic and stay young forever.\n\nWith most of the Ynn still recovering from war, nobody moved to oppose Mitrenya, except for Vyr Arok yen Clovenvels, a mercenary captain of Escanni origin who ventured into the forests of Vels Fadhecai and defeated her many minions. Together with a small party of his most elite troops he snuck into Mitrenya's castle, where they slew her after a hard-fought battle."

We would be wise not to take all those claims for granted, however it would be needlessly arrogant to write the entirety of their lot off as trouble-making outsiders.\n\nCooperation with the Cannorians opens up a great deal of opportunities, especially if we take the time to break down such a catch-all grouping as "Cannorians" into more specific terms such as "Ebenmassers", "West Tipneyans" and "Beggastonics", to truly see which of these peoples are worthy of our time, and of one day becoming our peers as the backbone of the Ynnic Empire."

All the riches of Nagar Vyechei, and the wealth of any who are able to afford the privilege, are stored within the vast complexes of Uyas Enret.\n\nIt is said the deepest vaults, so vast that they might never be fully filled even if the city were to last a thousand, thousand years, are guarded by a dragon pleased by the simple accumulation of wealth. No matter how true that is, what is certain is that there is no bank as secure as Uyas Enret."

Created by fermenting a prepared barrel of cashew paste, Pheni is very strong and very easy to find.\n\nThis drink is very effective at raising the mood of even the angriest being. Through widespread consumption, one will find that the populace will be far more agreeable to the dictates of the central government."

 G75_from_the_start_desc:0 "Sibisimra is a true and proper city, and a simple walk through its streets could tell you that. What they would not tell you, however, is the history of the city. Once, Sibisimra did not exist - in its place was a bandit camp, whose names were feared all across the Taychend for their expertise in pillaging. It was said that one of these bandit warbands could attack a town, wipe it of all worth, and leave for the next before word could get out.\n\nThough we are not bandits, and raiding has given way for actual warfare, these lessons were never forgotten. From the start, our troops have been master woodsmen and equally skilled pillagers. By moving quickly enough, our soldiers can intercept and plunder valuables before they are evacuated, thanks in no small part to our ability to navigate the land."

Anything we could ever need, anything we could ever want, one can find it in the domains of Larankar! Our men are no strangers to adversity, and even on a national scale we feel similarly. We take what is our due, for we require nothing less to survive in this brutal world.\n\nFew can expect negotiation with the lordship of Sibisimra when it requires something, and for this reason few will contest it. We require no pretense for war, for we are strong and we will use our strength to claim our hard-won rights!"

 G75_vatesheran_the_woolen_cloaked_desc:0 "Of all the rulers of Sibisimra, Vatesheran is perhaps the greatest of them all. Born into an unremarkable life, they were gifted with a remarkable charisma and used it to bring much of Sibisimra over to their side, then created a true state out of the then-still bandit kingdom. One of the most important of his reforms was the creation of the "Woolen Cloaks", an appropriately named permanent army which he then put to work carving out a true domain, and a real city to govern it. After a long and successful reign, he ascended to godhood and his mortal form was buried in Hessamadha.\n\nMany of his reforms are, by modern standards, redundant and outdated. However, one stands out: the Woolen Cloaks. Their traditions have molded them into some of Taychend's finest, and we shall forever keep it that way."

 G75_the_perfect_cut_desc:0 "Few things in this world are ever truly perfect, yet Sibisimra has the proud honor of being one of those places where perfection might be found. Renowned the world over - at least, they will be - a special brand of gem is mined and then also carved in the gem temple, Matnadevela.\n\nOver centuries of acquiring new techniques, acquiring their creators, and combining them, our gem production has been honed to perfection. Though aquamarine is the greatest of our cuts - likely because its expertise is fully home-grown - all of our jewels are extremely valuable. For a token sum, nearly anyone can be swayed to extents that would be inconsiderable otherwise. Let us take advantage of that."

A sun elf from the domain of Rezankand could more-than-likely best 5 of his enemies before being brought down himself.\n\nThankfully for us, they are few in number. If it takes ten, twenty, a hundred soldiers to kill one, so be it! Every death we inflict is one they cannot take back, and our manpower is plentiful. Already, one such invasion from them has been put aside by the unending numbers of the Woolen Cloaked! If they think themselves the sun, then we shall blot it out!"

 G75_meritocratic_raiders_desc:0 "A very important lesson that all bandits learn is that birthright means nothing. If they were led by noblemen for no other reason than gentle birth, then they would be cut down and slaughtered. The leader of a band of raiders must be a strong commander and a capable leader. If we have learned nothing from our legacy as bandits, it is that considering noblemen as the only candidates for leadership is lethal.\n\nIndeed, all individuals considered capable are valid candidates to command an army, and even the gentry has enough sense to know that the commoner in an otherwise "noble" occupation has earned their role. Coincidentally, this openness makes it far easier to find capable leaders."

The only difference is, we were blessed with the circumstances to truly contest ownership of the city. Any who might control the whole thing would be the undisputed master of Taychend. That was nearly us!\n\nOf course, it would have been if we were not thwarted by the efforts of a captain from the distant lands of Busilar, who brought an entourage of cannons and, funded by both Orenkoraim and the sun elves, brought our troops to rout through the awesome firepower of artillery. When we march upon the city once more, we shall level its defenses through our own cannons! Never say we are unable to learn a lesson!"

And the blood of a Marlliander? Pristine, well-kept, bred-for over generations and not a drop allowed to be polluted.

 H74_the_legacy_of_dak_chaingrasper_desc:0 "The legendary Dak Chaingrasper was a goblin mage of immense power who ascended to clanboss of Chaingrasper in 1420, at the age of 24. Aside from being an immensely powerful mage, Dak was also a brilliant administrator and general. In the early days of his rule, He brought the Chaingrasper clan to fully dominate the other clans within the hold of Ovdal-az-Ân and expanded the clan’s influence to surrounding sections of the Dwarovar. Beyond his military achievements, Dak also implemented a complex system of administration. His influence, and thus his greatness, runs to the very core of what the Chaingrasper Clan is today."

 H74_the_expansion_wars_desc:0 "As the Chaingrasper clan established itself in the Dwarovar, it became clear to the clan’s leadership that conquering and integrating the disunited goblins of the dens was necessary to the Clan’s survival and dominance. But expeditions to the west soon revealed a greater threat: the dwarves of Ovdal Kanzad and the Axebellow Cartel. The next decades of Chaingrasper’s existence would come to be defined by the long struggle to control the western section of the Tree of Stone and the many goblin lives lost during it."

This kind of control in goblin society can only be maintained via careful balancing and ensuring that powerful goblins feel they have a measure of control. This is accomplished in Chaingrasper via the Council of the Stone, an assembly of goblins who by virtue of wealth, influence, or ruthlessness have earned the ear of our clanboss. By setting these goblins against each other, the clanboss can maintain control while also staying well advised."

 H74_the_battleaxe_manifesto_desc:0 "Written by the retired soldier Dakez Orangebelt, the Battleaxe Manifesto was a radical political work that called for the organization of goblin society on highly militaristic lines. According to Dakez, the natural state of goblins is to war for resources. As a state is but an accumulation of its people, a goblin state must be in a constant state of war against its neighbors in order to secure resources and living space. Dakez's writings resulted in a surge of militarism in Chaingrasper at a time when the armies of Dak's empire were preparing to sweep through Rahen."

Because of this, the modern Railskulker clan is made up of goblins from many different origins who arrived at Er-Natvir at one time or another.

Throughout the seas patrolled by the Pinghoi armadas, one will rarely spot a vessel of a rival band, and only while it sinks from our cannons. Ironically, this means that many trade routes through our territory are safer than those outside, as a trader needs only pay a sufficient tribute to guarantee safety on the high seas."

In 1020, the Treaty of Anbenncóst which ended the war would grant the lands that became Galéinn to a newly founded knightly order, the Knights of the Saltmarch. Funded by the profits of the local salt mines, this order attracted those knights who favored boldness in tactics over personal bravery and prowess.\n\nEventually, as the Kingdom of Verne declined, the knightly order would crown its Grandmaster as a sovereign duke, later becoming a direct vassal of the Damerians. To this day, the Knights of the Saltmarch loyally serve the dukes of Galéinn as our most daring and skilled generals."

The home of a member of the clan will feature many coins hung or displayed as fetishes believed to bring luck and fortune. This focus on money means that members of the clan are easily able to judge the wealth of any goblin, orc or dwarf, making Blokroklan tax collectors frighteningly effective."
 H82_greedy_eyes:0 "Greedy Eyes"
 H82_greedy_eyes_desc:0 "There is nothing better at spotting out the vulnerabilities in a structure than the eyes of a thief, something that the enemies of Blokroklan know well. During a siege of an enemy fortress, Blokroklan goblins swarm around looking for places to carry off loot from. All too often, these enterprising looters discover the vulnerability that fells the fortress."

 H82_crimson_price:0 "Crimson Price"
 H82_crimson_price_desc:0 "All too often, money attracts enemies. When times of war come, Blokroklan must defend itself. Yet, standing armies are expensive. While perhaps more prone to casualties, a system of levies to quickly raise an army is the preferred system of Blokroklan."
 H82_coffee_cartels:0 "Coffee Cartels"

 H85_idea_3:0 "The Gamer Goblins"
 H85_idea_3_desc:0 "The goblins of Svetklan love a good game. Whether board games, puzzles, or sports you can always find a Svetklan goblin willing to partake. The highly competitive culture fostered by this leads to an excellent quality of leadership in the Svetklan military, as the officers constantly compete in simulated warfare and games of strategy."
 H85_idea_4:0 "The Value of Patience"
 H85_idea_4_desc:0 "Goblins are an impatient species, always looking for the next best thing or the quickest route to success. This is the greatest asset of goblins, driving them forward and allowing them to reach heights far beyond the other races. But Svetklan goblins are smarter than your average goblin. They know that there is a time and a place for patience. And all the better for it when it is time for haste."
 H85_idea_5:0 "Trade Warfare"
 H85_idea_5_desc:0 "While most think of piracy as restricted to open water, the Dwarovar is home to its own kind of piracy, conducted via twisting underground streams and artificial waterways. Drawing on their skill in knife to person communications, Svetklan has developed a hold on these cave pirates, and uses them to obtain an advantage over hostile competitors."
 H85_idea_6:0 "The Lessons of Leadership"
 H85_idea_6_desc:0 "The competitive spirit of Svetklan goblins extends to every aspect of their society, making positions of leadership particularly hotly fought over even by goblin standards.

 H85_idea_7:0 "An Ardour for Cannons"
 H85_idea_7_desc:0 "Artillery is beloved of cave goblins, but for the goblins of Svetklan, it goes beyond simple lust for explosions. It is a marriage sustained by a love of the intricate ins and outs of destructive fire. A love of the way that a cannonball can bounce through a formation. An obsession with calculating the proper altitude for an explosive shell to inflict maximum casualties. Within the disorganized piles of what passes for a library in Svetklan, hundreds of books on the use and making of cannons can be found as a testament to this love. When the time comes to use the wick, they know just the right spot."

By training new recruits in the rudimentary tactic of ducking when shot at, the forces of Usmaklan can pass down the tactics gleaned from fighting these foes."
 H87_idea_2:0 "Supply Before Demand"
 H87_idea_2_desc:0 "Though their clan is named the lonely clan, Usmaklan goblins have a keen business sense. Knowing well the laws of supply and demand, they have realized that in order to sell things, those things must be made. Usmaklan workshops are guarded from disruption on a full time basis, and harsh penalties are enforced on goblins whose squabbles interfere with productivity. The wheels of commerce spin thanks to the steady supply of grease these manufactories make."
 H87_idea_3:0 "The International Monetary Board"
 H87_idea_3_desc:0 "The seemingly innocuous name of the International Monetary Board is one feared by all those who do business with Usmaklan cartels. The hardened mercenaries of the IMB are ready to spring into action at a moment's notice to force a client's debtor to pay up. Usually heading straight for the leadership of a merchant guild or country that owes debt, entire kingdoms have been known to be ruined by the harsh conditions imposed by the IMB to force repayment. As well as the devastation that they cause in the process of getting it."
 H87_idea_4:0 "Goblin Snipers"
 H87_idea_4_desc:0 "While most goblins are content with fistfuls of explosives or complicated and loud blunderbusses, the cartel enforcers of Usmaklan prefer the lighter more precise touch of a sniper's weapon. The big holes they make don't hurt either."
 H87_idea_5:0 "Local Cartel Rule"
 H87_idea_5_desc:0 "Cartels are extremely powerful in the society of Usmaklan, engaging with the leadership in the same way that the powerful dukes and counts of Lorent once engaged with the king. It should come at no surprise then that much of the business of local rule is delegated to cartels, particularly in places with a mercantile interest for the state."
 H87_idea_6:0 "Fractal Market Penetration"
 H87_idea_6_desc:0 "Usmaklan maintains trading outposts in many places around the world, particularly the Deepwoods. Although the core lands of the clan can be considered off the beaten path as far as major trade routes go, they have an uncanny ability to shift those routes to accommodate their interests."
 H87_idea_7:0 "The Power of the Free Market"
 H87_idea_7_desc:0 "The invisible hand of the free market is said to be almost like a god for Usmaklan. The entire society of the clan rejects the nation of any outside control of the economy, letting the cartels run wild as they please. Critics of this system point to the untold suffering experienced by the lowest goblins of Usmaklan. But any Usmaklan goblin would be ready to reply with a quarterly report showing their economic growth."

 H89_idea_2:0 "Orc Slayers"
 H89_idea_2_desc:0 "Before the Greentide hit Escann, the goblin slave Rurnor Snotfinger lead a group of fellow goblin slaves into the nearby caverns, avoiding the fate of those who became the Common Goblins. Every goblin of Slozklan knows this story well, and knows the truth of why there can never be peace with orcs. They all must die.\n\nThankfully, others agree, and many humans were happy to turn a blind eye to Slozklan's wars against the Orcish kingdoms in Escann."
 H89_idea_3:0 "Free Goblins All"
 H89_idea_3_desc:0 "The goblins of Slozklan know to value freedom, for it is their namesake. It is thus that Slozklan allows no enslaved goblins. Downtrodden, disadvantaged, or disenfranchised certainly. But never enslaved."
 H89_idea_4:0 "Snotfinger University"
 H89_idea_4_desc:0 "Within the depths of Snotslair lies a great complex of goblin learning known as Snotfinger University. Established by the goblins of Slozklan as a school of engineering, it grew to become a city in its own right, serving to educate the next generation of goblin weapon-makers away from where they might blow up something important."
 H89_idea_5:0 "The Battle of Steelhyl"
 H89_idea_5_desc:0 "During the great war between Slozklan and Unguldavor, Slozklan initially experienced great success, blitzing through orcish defenses using terrifying war machines and hordes of goblins. However when the orcs rallied, they pushed the Slozklan armies all the way back to Steelhyl. General Mit entrenched the Slozklan armies upon the hill, and cleverly baited the commander of the orcish left flank into attacking before the rest of the orcish army arrived. The glorious victory won there that day paved the way for Slozklan's purge of orcs from Inner Castanor"
 H89_idea_6:0 "Trade Through The Khugsroad"

After making it, Slobald quickly, and fatally, discovered the lethal side effects of continued consumption of Gojuice.\n\nThankfully his daughter and lab assistant, Nopels, realized that the invention could still have applications. It is now used to help Slozklan soldiers run down retreating enemies,giving them a burst of speed and energy to ensure that none of the enemy escape to fight again."

 H84_idea_4:0 "The Jakzon Triskaidecagon"
 H84_idea_4_desc:0 "Invented by none other than Pether Jakzon, the Jakzon Triskaidecagon is a strange and seemingly impractical formation more suited to a parade ground than actual warfare. The level of coordination and leadership needed to successfully implement the formation means that it challenges even expert generals, making it a great challenge for up-and-coming officers to practice their ability to lead in the confused chaos of battle."
 H84_idea_5:0 "Army Bands"
 H84_idea_5_desc:0 "Ever since the reforms of Pether Jakzon, the armies of Divlklan have been accompanied by large bands of musicians whose music serves to inspire the men. This makes a Divlklan battle quite a strange and spectacular affair, with stirring battle music accompanying the sounds of battle."
 H84_idea_6:0 "The Great Generals"
 H84_idea_6_desc:0 "There have been many great generals in Divlklan's past. Jararar Tolzheen, whose leadership and clever use of magic lead to victory over Shattered Crown and the sacking of Amldihr. Pether Jakzon, whose flair for showmanship led him to stunning victories that reverberated throughout the known world. Gazdalk the White, who showed the Dwarfs of Gor Burad that magic still meant something against the might of industry. All these and less legendary figures have lead the armies of Divlklan.

The hill on which it stands is lined with ancient, crumbling stones rumored to stretch back to the depths of time, to fortifications that stood well before even the Castanite Exodus. The latest fortress on the site was built following the establishment of the modern state of the Brinkmarches during the Aldresian Crusade, but even it remains influenced by our unique regional style. The unseen, puzzle-piece protrusions that intricately weave the stones of our walls into unyielding patterns make our fortifications especially resilient to spells, cannons, and any other trouble that would come up against them.

No, the Azka-Suri knew their place was as the shield of the faithful, to be brandished by the heirs of Jaher in order to protect Bulwar from the Darkness in the Salahad and beyond.

Their main inspiration following their wars in the Salahad was the Desert Legion who, while heretics, were also direct heirs to the legions of Jaher, praised be his name.\n\nWhile never as disciplined or skilful as the Legionaries they fought – and how could they be, when the legions were comprised of the Chosen who have centuries to master their arts and have the blood of Surael running in their veins – the Surani legionaries were nonetheless a deadly and feared force in all Bulwar."

And even she could not capture him; their duel ended in a mortal blow to Demos, the matriarch fluttering away with a wing sliced off (she would die of her wounds a few weeks later).\n\nAfterwards, the local farmers hesitantly approached the hero's corpse, and unmasked him for the first time. They discovered that he was a half-elf, the only one ever known to walk the fields of Kumarkand.

Adorning it, the artifact began to glow faintly, and immediately his magical items fell useless to his side. Whatever he had discovered, it seemed to grant a level of magical immunity to its wearer.\n\nThe Akal would claim the helmet (and its companions discovered in later expeditions) as Kumarkand's rightful property upon Fula's death, and they would become the core of an elite mage-resistant force within the state's armies.

There, under the Imperial campaign tent, Erelessa, head of the Legion, presented a boy called Jaddar as the rightful heir to the Jaherian bloodline. His claim to succession was rejected by most leaders present, and he and most of the Legionaries went East into the Salahad.  Meanwhile, Taelarios of Irrliam took the lead in splitting the Empire among the various Elves who all rose from governors to Kings. \n\nWhile the peace it created did not endure, with two more Cinder Wars in the 13th century, the Kalib partition made the city of Kalib famous, and paved the way for a diplomatic tradition the Kalibi are renowned for throughout Bulwar."

But no one in Halann has a material as fine, embroidery as elegant, or colours as radiant as Sardiphadin silk. (Or at least, so they would have you believe.)"

But for Sardiphadin, a different nigh-apocalypse happened five centuries prior, when in 503 BA visiting Zanbari merchants snuck into a silk facility and absconded with a few silkworms, along with the secrets of silk production. Sardiphadin's greatest secret was out, and would never be recaptured.\n\nEven centuries after, the scars still go deep: from a reflexive distrust of foreigners, to the rumored secret police that patrol the city and keep its dealings well-hidden."

A lavish complex composed of numerous soaring spires, silk ribbons blowing atop each, it has been the city's distinctive landmark ever since its construction. Still, for most, it is largely associated with Harimar the Great.\n\nDuring his rapid conquests after unifying the harimari living in the Jungles of Ascension, Sardiphadin was one of the first major cities to bow to his rule. It is said that, upon receiving their surrender, Harimar climbed to the Temple of Towers' highest point. There, he proclaimed that all he saw would soon bow before him — and he was right."

This gave Sardiphadin the opportunity to market their silks directly to these wealthy buyers, rather than having to rely on Bulwari merchants to transport them. This served two purposes: they could avoid working with those untrustworthy thieves, and also maximize their own profits. Soon, Sardiphadin silks could be seen as far away as Anbenncóst or even in Marlliande's most lavish estates."

They already know the secrets of silk-production, so there are no costs to letting them into Sardiphadin's inner-most sanctums, and they are sworn to protect their charge with their lives. At its peak, the Harimraj banned such practices, treating the Bhuvauri more as foe than friend, but as the ministries grew corrupt Sardiphadin was quick to take advantage. A number of companies have been on direct retainer from Bhuvauri for decades now, and these contracts are the bedrock of Sardiphadin's defenses.\n\nSome thought to reconsider this arrangement after the "Typhoon of Broken Vases" in 1699 AA, when the Bhuvauri were bribed by Lorent with vast sums of money and exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their employers in the Porcelain Cities (recompense for the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage).

And each, of course, needed a new flag to symbolize their new status.\n\nSardiphadin was always quick to leap at this opportunity. One of the first envoys each new monarch would receive was a silk-merchant from Sardiphadin, bearing a rendition of the new banner in finest silk. This gift would pay great dividends — Sardiphadin could expect an order for more renditions within a year, and it always ingratiated these rising powers to the City of Silk."

But most notable is the coming-of-age ritual every male and female Tudhinai goes through at age sixteen: they must spend three days alone in the desert, with only a single waterskin and a loincloth.

But although they were not heavy-handed in their rule, and sought to win over the populace with lavish festivals and generous policies, the Tudhinai chafed nonetheless.\n\nRooted in the Unbroken Claw school's long-standing grudge with the Radiant Sun, the shepherds were often late in their taxes, only paid lip service to Jadd rituals, and nigh-refused to join its legions.

Aboard this ship was a group of three Ravelian missionaries, led by one Lucian Carter. Intrigued by their words and talk of one god, the pirates took them home.\n\nCarter and his companions swiftly set to instructing the locals. Their work in education greatly helped the poor locals, as they set up schools and hospitals in various places. Along with their aid they brought a new faith and a new single god. Their Ravelian teachings did not spread far into Bulwar, but they certainly took hold on the Drolas, who saw their god as the one that lightened the hardships that they had gone through under Surakel."

They drove back the gnolls, and the Anzabadi were among the first freed by these newcomer saviors. In their liberation, they reclaimed the phrase, and so the chained sun militia was formed.

Anzabad has never forgotten, nor forgiven, them for this crime.\n\nAt its best, this rivalry pushes every Anzabadi merchant to perform to the utmost, knowing any deal around the Divenhal which does not dock at our ports may very well dock at theirs. At its worst, such as in the brief chaotic period following the death of Taelarios Irrliazuir, it has lead to the sugar-marshes of the peninsula being watered with human blood, and full-scale privateering efforts crippling trade in the eastern Divenhal."

But in 1501 AA, with Gnollakaz having seized Kheterata in the south, and the encroaching Jaddari to the east, Akal Baraz szel-Aban began a project to build up the old ruins to their former glory.

And this belief is only reinforced by the Sunlily berry, one of the more interesting and curious plants native to the region.\n\nWhen consumed, the berry grants a man the energy to go through an entire day, requiring no other food and only a small libation of water. No doubt this is a small emanation of Surael himself, all his life-giving energies condensed into one small ounce of creation. It is what ensures we can tend our fields with care, despite our dispersed population and strife-rife lands."

When Barseen took control of the place, it was little more than a pile of ruins. His son Bavar I, with his Akalate flourishing, ordered the restoration of the old fortress and turned it into a palace.

Thinking the Eordan savages who would be easy to dispatch with their advanced weaponry, the Guild fleet fell into a carefully prepared trap. When their sailors were loading the ammunition into the guns, the Einnsagger druids summoned a storm that drenched the enemy. No ordinary storm, the rain still contained the brine of the sea, not just a nuisance but corroding the gears and making their weaponry unsafe to fire. In the end more than half of the experimental guns were inoperable, at which the primitive Einnsagger fleet sank them into the sea."

In a different timeline, Ladrana would be remembered as the uniting matriarch of the Tuathak: but she was already too late and did not notice their eminent demise.\n\nWhilst the Tuathak leaders were gathered in Dorcurt, a Peitar army struck from the depths of the Domandrod. The folly of Dorcurt was the assumption that no large forces could arrive from the Domandrod because of the restrictions on entry enforced by the Gladewardens and fey spirits within. The Tuathak Legion guards were quickly overwhelmed, unprepared to fight such a large force so quickly, and almost all those gathered at the conclave were murdered by the balance-obsessed zealots. The Sonad of Raithtall, Urian Oakgardner fought to avenge his comrades, but was pierced with a poisoned blade. Miraculously, Urian was recovered and returned to Raithtall by a trusted compatriot, but lived the last few years of his life infirm and in constant pain.

A holy war to end the Winter once and for all was declared: once the Snecboth and their lands were conquered by Eighard and their allies, they could end their idolatry and cease the hated season forever!\n\nThe Hibernal Crusade won victory after victory, crushing the Winter Court and seizing the lands eastward towards what would become Jhorgashirr and Slegcal. All that remained was Gemradcurt, but the Esbagg of Eighard, Andrall Harvestcrown, knew that their allies would seize their conquered lands and sought to force their loyalty at Minnorac, the Field of Oaths. This proved to be a cataclysmic mistake, for they were ambushed there by the Strutmar Peitar and the unity of the Hibernal Crusade was shattered with the death of Esbagg Andrall Harvestcrown.\n\nFollowing the ambush at Minnorac, the remaining leadership of the Hibernal Crusade rushed to consolidate power and seized control of the conquered lands, forming the traitorous states of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal.

At first viewed as a troublesome but unimportant heretical cult by the mainstream Autumn Court who favor the aspect of Autumn as the season of harvest and preparation, the Cult of Rot seized control of Eighard overtime, slowly replacing the governorship until even their Esbagg adhered to their practices.\n\nTheir most infamous practice was the construction of a new prison in Darblath, a squat but deep building extending far into the earth, where heretics and prisoners were locked in pit-like cells and left until their body decayed into soil. The many bones left behind were showcased as a warning to would-be troublemakers, with some thrown into a massive pile outside the prison as example, and others left in a long corridor all over the floor and walls where domestic and foreign dignitaries were reminded of their fate should they fail."

Home to only scattered tribes of Snecboth unable to fight off Ewandil's army, the Tuathak forged a new realm named after the natural harbor shaped like a spear thrust into the Randrunnse.\n\nFortune struck Slegcal, for in their southern reaches bordering the Egasach brilliantly shining gemstones were found peaking through the barren soil. First thought to be emeralds, the gemstones were underlain by curiously undulating green and blue stone: malachite and azurite, copper ore!

The secret alloy used by the bladesmiths resembles the bronze used throughout Eordand but for its curious iridescence, owing to the rare and glittering black rocks near the compound.

Until Cannorian powers began importing cheaper iron wares, Slegcaler iron could be found throughout Eordand.

Armonadhi tools and artifacts have been found in the hinterlands by wandering miners, but Snecboth history tells of how the Armonadhi met their end. The Snecboth, while recognizing that all seasons are not equal but unwise in trusting the cold death of Winter, migrated to Galbhan and Armonadh. The ancient Armonadhi fought back against the Snecboth, but could not handle face the superior magic and equipment preserved from our Domandrod heritage.'\n\n'As the reader should be aware of already, Slegcal was founded by Tuathak Hibernal Crusaders after the ambush at Minnorac shattered the Crusade's leadership. Our founder, Ewandil Firstborn recognized the promise of this land and that the clergy of Eighard would have no say over our new realm. Ewandil pacified the unruly Snecboth by instituting a fair taxation system: those that do not recognize the superiority of Autumn over all else may be permitted to live in peace in exchange for an increased tithe.

However, its beauty did not impress the ever-fickle Fey, who were instead threatened by its ability to injure draconic and fey creatures. The fey demanded that it be destroyed; the Gladewarden who forged the sword refused and fled with it beyond the Armonadh mountains, never to return.\n\nCenturies later, Darran Eaglesthorn set Slegcal on a mad quest to retrieve Dracball. Contact with the peoples of the Ynnic river valley spread tales of Dracball, supposedly having slain a mighty dragon at war with the Rzentur centuries ago! Raising his host in the far north near the Broken Sea in 1782, Darran Eaglesthorn marched into Dragon Dominion lands towards Arganjuzorn, intent on retrieving the legendary sword. While the Rzentans proved to be untrustworthy vassals, breaking their oaths near instantly, the people of Arganjuzorn recognized their status as subjects to Slegcal. Agreements were made with the Dragon Dominion to allow Slegcaler movement along the upper Ynn, and the first Eordan embassy was established in Svemel.\n\nAt last victorious, Darran drew Dracball from its hilt and spent nearly a month testing it against the monsters of the Epednar plains, including slaying a mighty Poskawa Whale, a gigantic mountain-like fish monster that blends into the rockfields. When news of Cannorian mercenaries invading Slegcal reached Darran, he returned home to face off these invaders but was already too late. Darran Eaglesthorn met his end speared with bayonet during the defense of Eirminn, clutching the bloodied legendary blade beyond death until his fingers were cut off by a looter. It is said that the Juzornic lords assembled their retinues alongside Darran, hoping that Slegcal may prove an invaluable ally against both Ynnic and Cannorians.

However, they began to talk of unity to defeat the Winter Court in their holy war, a case far too dangerous to ignore. The Eordellon faithful agreed and assembled an army to quell their unity, and were granted passage through the Domandrod by the Fey Lords for enforcing the balance.\n\nGathered in their seditious conclave, the leaders of the Autumn Court were an easy target to eliminate, for Dorcurt lies not far from the Domandrod's obscuring borders.

Despite their obsession with trivial matters, the Arakepruni had amassed great knowledge, population, and the wealth to use them. To combat this threat the Iadthi allied with a useful Spring heretic: Manaron Goldtree of Elchos, vassal of Arakeprun. Goldtree sought to liberate his possessions from the clutching grasp of the Arakepruni scholar-clergy, and garnered support from across Arakeprun's nobility to stage an armed rebellion.\n\nPelomar, always imagining themselves the great hero of old, took this as the prime opportunity to weaken their rival, while Iadth allied with the upstart Elchosi for purely practical matters of resolving our volatile border with Arakeprun. The border territory of Tasmet had long been disputed between Dorcurt and Arakeprun, but Iadth had no use for the Autumnal heretics that dwelt there.

The brothers, seeking an opportunity of a lifetime, asked to build a center of artificery led by them. The dragon, who usually masqueraded in ruinborn form, seeing the practical use of artificery and perhaps kinship with his misbegotten cousins, granted their wish.

By the time it did, this composite army was already too big to not give it support without risking having their holding sacked for “standing in the way of the Dragon’s will”. Some of those lords gave the army supplies and safe passage through their lands, while others joined the totality of their force to them.\n\nThis army, despite being massive, was heavily infantry based, as well as plagued by organisation issues.

For the goblins, they had always been a selfish lot. In their dark undergrowth of the Serpentspine they crawled over each other and killed each other for scraps, living truly to a "every goblin for themselves" mentality.\n\nUs kobolds, however, had to survive, but we did that together. We lived closely with our people and learned to share in our resources and tribulations, so it was no surprise that when we came to Haraf that the gnomes and goblins went their usual way in their treatment of the ruinborn - seeing them as lessers or a thing to get rid of. But we welcomed them with open arms, and in time they proved themselves as great members of our society, and many, like the famous warriors of the Kalun Masks, served in our armies with pride."

Rocks replaced with shrapnel bombs, tripwires replaced with laser sensors, and pressure plates made into land mines.

A great achievement enabled by this technology Zurzumexia's "Scion District", filled to the brim with structures sitting high above the rest of the city without any walkways, as the inhabitants of these high sections fly between buildings like the dragon scions of old."

For Mestikardu, this resulted several very powerful families holding power in the city, and together they formed an agreement to put the stability of the city, and their families, above all."

On the other hand, Sizapzarko would lend to anybody, particularly those with a shortsighted desire to get rich adventuring. Either they succeed and the incredibly high rates mean Sizapzarko makes a huge profit, or they fail and become basically owned by debt.

Lithe and dextrous, with the strength afforded to the rough life in the jungle, these ruinborn voltoj found a place amongst the elite guards of the city, and with their ability to traverse the jungles (due to their height), they eventually found themselves as the principal commanders of the Kardun armies."

Losing a paw in a duel to the soon-to-be Emperor, he submitted to Harimar's rule, going from major warlord to a minor lieutenant during the conquest of Rahen. But the wound Brajar took never fully healed, and a few years later, it festered until he died of infection.\n\nHis son, Vamayur, was more talented with pen and parchment than sword and shield, and came to Harimar's attention just as he was beginning to be faced with the challenges of governing all his conquered lands. Vamayur was instrumental in drafting the Harimraj's first set of laws and ordinances, many of which are still in force today. It was for this service, not any of his father's military deeds, that his dynasty earned the lands of Pasiragha, and furthermore, through intricate loopholes and clever designs he ensured it a place of prominence in the court beyond its seeming stature.\n\nNear the end of his life, Vamayur compiled his lessons and wisdom into a tome, Vamayur's Codex, which was passed down from generation to generation, and from senapti to senapti during the latter Harimraj. Though said to be secret, over the centuries a few copies were made — finding their way into a certain estate's bookshelves in Sramya, and a constant guide to the young Senapti Mahapalar of the Flower Oath — and once the printing press arrived in Rahen, it was disseminated far and wide, even making it to the eunuch training schools at Tianlou.

Though originally restricted to High Philosophy scholars, by the time that Jadd missionaries were coming east, it had opened its doors to any one with an idea worth discussing. Even amidst the turmoil of 16th and 17th century Rahen, the palace only grew and thrived: it was where the Nahana Jadd defined its tenets, became a hub for Raheni artificery, and by the early 19th century one could find scholars from as far afield as Konwell and Aqatbar joining its lively debates."

With western Rahen's subjugation to the burgeoning Jadd Empire in the 16th century, there was much criticism to be levied — but given the Lightbringers' foreboding presence in the region, few wanted to voice their opinions out loud or explicitly write them down.\n\nInstead, many in Pasiragha took advantage of the newest inventions brought by Bulwari traders across the Salahad: the printing press. Philosophers and comics alike turned to political cartoons as a way of expressing their thoughts on contemporary affairs. These quickly became a staple of the Raheni political scene, and by the early 1700s, a pamphlet printed in Pasiragha could be found inspiring debate and discussion in Srayen or Sarisung within days of its creation."

Within it, the porcelain workers felt safe to revel in their riches. But everything changed when Harimar attacked.\n\nThough the walls were insurmountable, the gates were not. The harimari troops quickly breached the city's mighty gates, and quickly overran its defences. But Harimar was a benevolent conqueror, and he saw the value of a kind example in bringing the rest of the Porcelain Cities under his paw. Instead of sacking the city, he allowed its rulers to proclaim him sovereign. Then, before he left, he ensured the shattered gates would be rebuilt out of pure porcelain, a shining white beacon so that all would remember how quickly he had seized the city — and his mercy afterward.\n\nThe days of the old Harimraj are long gone now, but the White Gate still stands, the symbol of Khiraspid and harder than any wood or stone. And though hobgoblins threaten from the north, zealots threaten from the east, Khiraspid's White Gate will stand strong, nigh-insurmountable, against them."

Not a single individual, no matter their fitness or position, is allowed to shun this duty, and it ensures that Khiraspid never goes without a well-manned guard.\n\nThe other Porcelain Cities often looked down on this practice, which meant an apprentice porcelain-worker would share a spear with a street urchin, especially when mercenary forces and Bhuvauri slave soldiers were well-trained, plentiful, and cheap. But it would pay off in 1699 AA, when following the execution of an elven diplomat accused of porcelain espionage, Lorent paid the Bhuvauri a vast sum and promised them exclusive Cannorian trade rights to turn on their would-be masters and sack the city of Keyattordha. That city was left ravaged, and the slave soldiers also looted a few others as they abandoned the Porcelain Guilds' contracts in full.

Alas, all good things must come to an end.\n\nIn 1507 Tluukt's old enemies, the Jaddari, declared the final war against the gnolls in Bulwar. While some traitorous gnolls sided with the elves and accepted the Jadd, the loyal gnolls of Tluukt fought to the last soldier, but despite their ferocity were pushed back all the way into the recently restored Ekluzagnu. Here, the Jaddari led an extremely long and costly siege, fighting floor by floor to kill every single gnoll in the fortress. Ironically, the very same place destroyed by Xhazobine ended up being the site of last stand of gnollish rule in Bulwar."

Varbuk was one of these half-orcs, having been born in Dalaire to an orcish mother and a human master.\n\nIn 1597 after witnessing his master brutally kill his mother, Varbuk managed to break free and killed his master along with his entire family, liberating orcish and half-orcish slaves. Calling themselves 'Varbuk's Freemen', they moved around Dalaire freeing other slaves and causing havoc on the colonists. The revolt was seeing plenty of success until the colonial armies managed to secure few key victories and pushing former slaves deeper into Dalaire.\n\nHaving nowhere else to go, Varbuk led his men into the Cursed Forest. Colonial armies chose to let them go, believing they would perish against the Cursed Ones. However, that was not the case.\n\nAfter several years of traversing the forest and fighting off the locals, Freemen have emerged on the other side.

Outraged by that act, Varbuk declared that half-orcs can't rely on anyone but themselves and must build their own future. \n\nThis policy has persisted long after Varbuk's death.

 H51_the_bond_breaker_desc:0 "Cursed Ones have been a constant opponent of half-orcs even during Varbuk's initial crossing of the forest, in part due to Kinbond - a telepathic link that allows Cursed Ones to communicate with each other at a distance. Fortunately, Freemarches wasn't the only country with desire to tame the forest.\n\nGnome from the Broken Sea faced the same problem of Cursed Ones' raids and resistance. To combat them, they invented the Bond Breaker - a small metallic rod that operates at the same frequency as Kinbond, distracting and confusing the affected Cursed Ones for a short period of time. The rod however could work only at a short distance. In order to properly test and utilise this new invention gnomes needed to get close enough to the Cursed Ones.\n\nNot willing to waste their own lives for this, the artificers contacted Freemarches with an offer. They would employ some half-orcs and have them venture into the forest alongside gnomish expeditions to act as a protection against the Cursed Ones, and in return gnomes would provide some Bond Breakers for Freemarcher use. Half-orcs accepted gnomish offer, and this dual endeavor greatly decreased half-orcish losses against their old enemies."

When goblins first invaded this region during the Exodus they made no attempts to learn any of these foreign languages. As they began transitioning from roaming hordes to proper states and interacting with the locals more frequently the problems of communication became clear as day. Initially, Overclan's government proposed the creation of a new language by combining all those present in Bahar, but it was deemed an unnecessary waste of time and effort.\n\nThe actual solution was the employment of non-goblins who taught goblin administrators, diplomats and rulers in those local languages, while encouraging all others to follow suite. Having a polylingual administration was a sure way of securing both Bahari population's support and making diplomacy easier."

Very few were willing to work for these former invaders, especially in the bureaucracy, as that meant having a near constant contact with goblins. An intriguing solution was proposed by Overboss Dramkork in 1529 - raising orphans as bureaucrats. Many locals have lost their families during the Decades of Devastation, Goblin Exodus and during the Samartal investigations and were left with nothing, fighting for scraps on the streets. Overclan provided those children with shelter and food, in hopes the children would work for them.\n\nThe program was a success, with the Overclan raising a proper bureaucratic force within just a decade, which was fully utilised in the subsequent Bahari-wide programs.\n\nA large portion of said orphans was made of Voltoj - half-goblins, who were not always orphans, but castaways from their families. While some human orphans held hatred for goblins, blaming them for their condition, Voltoj unanimously embraced the Overclan and each other as their new family."

Those were mostly made of indebted peasants and soldiers, both of which were disillusioned with Elven rule and hostile to the invading goblins, who plagued the countryside and occasionally even raided the larger cities.\n\nAfter goblins have secured their rule in Bahar, many of human adventurers turned to banditry as well. Those former adventurers did not recognise Overclan and saw goblins as mere monsters, harassing any goblin controlled cities and punishing non-goblins for what they saw as supporting the enemy.\n\nThe issue was resolved only following the formation of Overclan. Scouring of the bandits became the first truly united effort in the Overclan, with goblin, human and even some elven veterans working together to end this issue. The proposed solution was the creation of a volunteer militia, which was trained in combined goblin-human-elven tactics and spread throughout the region. The volunteers consisted primarily of those directly affected by the bandits.\n\nWhile Overclan's main armies were focused on securing the integrity of this newfound nation, the militia secured its internal stability by fighting the bandits, while also trying to convince adventurers to stop the raids. The bandit plague met its final end in 1547, when the volunteer militia cleared out the occupied citadel of Azka-szel-Azka, which has been used by bandits as a safe haven. The militia was not disbanded however, and continued patrolling the Bahari countryside since."

In order to do that however goblins needed to atone for the damage caused by their Exodus. That was done with a 37 year long process known as the Decades of Restoration.\n\nWhile primarily Decades of Restoration focused on restoring razed buildings, rejuvenating old farms and resettling abandoned villages, its primary function was to convince other races of Bahar to accept goblin rule. The first few goals were achieved relatively easily, but the racial integration saw heavy resistance. The solution came in a form of Voltoj.\n\nFollowing the creation of a new bureaucracy made out of orphans, half-goblins became an integral part of the Overclan administration and actively participated in the Decades of Restoration. Local Bahari preferred working with more humane looking Voltoj than goblins. Seeing this, the Overclan decided to nearly entirely transfer the integration part of the program to the half-goblins. As expected, half-goblins made considerably better effort in securing good relations with other races, further increasing their standing within the Overclan as they were seen as a thematic representation of Overclan's racial syncretism."

Before the unification of Bahar however, goblin navies were the weakest in the Divenhal, having been sunk by human, elven and dwarven navies on numerous occasions. Once the Overclan formed and integrated other races' designs into their own, the goblin fleet became a common sight in the Divenhal.\n\nDuring the early 1600s, a goblin writer Zyt the Short wrote a history of the goblinkind, in which he claims that goblins have previously conquered two frontiers - the caves of the Serpentspine and the forests of Escann - and that now Exodus Goblins have begun the conquest of the ocean, also known as the Third Frontier. Unsurprisingly, this thought became popular in the Overclan, partially as a reaction to recent successes of Bayvek and Mestikardu, two other seafaring goblin nations.

The religion and conversion to it were heavily promoted by the government. Yet Ravelianism only became popular with goblins, with nearly all remaining shamanists having chosen to convert and adopt Ravelian teachings and encouraging Cannorian artificers to move to Bahar.

But Amarien saw an opportunity in this devastation: she decided to recruit many of the elves that could not fight in the Legions, or who had already fought but had gotten injured (and left without a manor tended by humans to retire to), to immigrate to her lands. There they toiled the fields, rebuilt whole villages and cities and sponsored a strong elven culture in the hills and mountains\n\nNowadays, nowhere in Bulwar one finds so many sun elves as in Birsartanšes.

But given Birsartanšes' many copper mines, and the tragedies of the internecine Birsartanšesi-Baharkandi war (1419-1423) and the following Dartaxes rebellion (1422-1436), it seemed to many that artillery would be safer than relying on mages.\n\nThe first great cannon of the Birsartanšes army was built by a dwarven engineer from Ovdal-Tungr named Ungrim Thunderhammer, and was at the time the biggest artillery piece outside the Dwarovar. Called Ordalanner in honor of his creator, the cannon was so massive it needed 50 oxen to be moved. This great weapon was instrumental in the siege of the great Dartaxerdim fortress of Kuzak in 1484, its fire shattering the walls in a way only the most powerful of archmage could match.\n\nThe country's early interest was only furthered as artillery progressed over the years, and as the safety of operating a cannon increased, the need for human or dwarven engineers were soon replaced by Sun Elves who became experts in operating the machinery and the black powder.

They would do so by passing an examination that was the same for everybody, everywhere in the kingdom.\n\nThe new class of bureaucrats was still predominantly elven and from the old aristocracy, for only they could spend entire years studying for the examinations, but the testing process allowed the state to remove the corrupt and unsuitable administrators that had plagued it."

The most popular one concerned Dartaxes’ father and helped explain to many why this human family had grown to become officers in the Birsartanšesi army, even though Dartaxes himself denied it publicly. To ensure that this problem grew no further, the Jaherian Exemplars in Birsartanšes were tasked to apply the ‘Cleanliness of Blood’ Edict, or in Sun Elven 'Silsun Sirad', which required every person applying to serve the state to demonstrate a pure ancestry in either human or elven blood.\n\nThe role of these Exemplars expanded over the years as they began to examine human villages and quarters for individuals who looked "too elven". By the late 1500s, their power was so great that they could even dare to publicly target a prince of the royal family. Taelar, grandson of Arantir and minor prince of the royal family, was caught in an affair with the palace singer and dancer Emmita Nuartu, and got her pregnant.

Prominent figures gather for a soirée during which they wear elaborate masks, drink the finest Jaherian Sunlight, and dance to the sound of famous bands from all over Bulwar.

What would allow the Phoenix to rekindle its flames? It would be creating the perfect state, and putting the needs of the state above all else.\n\nShe was the one to craft the now famous ‘Kuil szel-Laded’ (‘State Reason’) philosophy, the idea that immoral actions could be justified if the state required it.

And every lunar month when the Moon disappears, the Kuzarami lighten their homes and the whole mountains and pray for two days for Kuza to reappear.

But the mountain clans were deeply loyal to the Amarienzuir dynasty, for it was Amarien of Imulušes that had burnt the last harpy nests in the mountains and freed the Kuzarami.

His poem ‘Utur-Irnitu’ (Great Success) made the phrase famous throughout Bulwar as he boasted at how pathetic the Gelkari were in their endeavors compared to the mighty Kuzarami.\n\nMaking enemies everywhere he went, he was forced to travel throughout his life and decided one day to leave for Aelantir.

Several minor tribes also fled to the east, and were integrated into the Szal-Adad.

As the nomads deliberated what to do with the deposed god-king, one of the Djinn from the Salahad arrived in the city. She said to the chieftain that the only way to deal with Amussu was imprisoning him for all eternity, and that she was willing to lead a group of warriors to a place where they could build a prison and guard it.\n\nThe warriors doubted the sincerity of the Djinn, whose interest seemed to be to prevent the rise of new genie-binders. But they accepted the offer, and thus, Ardeth and his kin followed the Djinn to the most distant reaches of the Salahad, when they found an oasis in the depths of a basin surrounded by mountains. There, in the deepest section of the gorge, they build a prison for the god king. Neither Ardeth or their kin ever returned to the eastern plains or the banks of the Suran; they never witnessed the glory of Karqašlu or the darkness of the age of monsters. They stayed in the Nihruqalu, the Silent Hall. Standing guard. Protecting a land that they will never inhabit.\n\nBut at some point their numbers dwindled, and they had to interact with the Salahadesi nomads that would become the Mašnih. They showed to their leaders the unkillable evil that they watch over. The tribal leaders offered to send warriors to nurture the ranks of the szal-Ardeth, and since then, when  needed, the wardens recruit both men and women from the other tribes.

While most of the former slaves fled south and formed the kingdom of Dasmazar, Yazkur and several warriors stayed and managed to occupy the Harra oasis for a decade, before being expelled by the gnolls.\n\nAnother great clan member was Ekrem szal-Yazkur, who lost an arm fighting Zokka, and during the Battle of Sun's Providence,  tried to kill the Pack-Lord before Jaddar could.

For twelve years he survived, until one night, he and other magi managed to escape. How? Nobody knows, but the group fled to the east, trying to reach Rahen. Many were lost in the desert, and one by one died, until only Fazil and eight more remained. They would not have survived if not for their stumbling upon the lost city and its oasis. There they found the knowledge of Ancient Bulwar, and they decided to keep it safe until the Bulwari were free to practice magic in their own home. They adopted a silver nine point star as sigil, representing the nine original magi and the brightest star in the night sky, Fazil.\n\nThe szal-Fazil are renowned for their wisdom and use of magic, and their magi are usually found in other tribes as advisors. The future leader of the tribe, Kuridon szal-Fazil, was living between the szal-Zaid at the same time as Jaddar began his campaign, and the two became close friends.

Even after conquest, legions of Lightbringers could not stamp out this rebellious spirit, and the city remained firmly (if quietly) defiant of the Jadd. The resistance largely consisted of late tax payments and underground dissension — that is, until Surael blessed their cause with a Jadd civil war.\n\nDuring the Deioderan, Medurubar led the revolt against their Jadd overlords and helped secure the independence for several western Bulwari city-states. As the threat of the Jadd was not eliminated, and the Jaddanzar Empire left behind was certain to seek reconquest after licking its wounds, these states united into a loose federation known as 'Surakesi League', with Medurubar being elected the league's first leader."

When she arrived at the court of the Akal, the royal consort was suffering from an unknown illness. Within two days, she had discovered that the illness came from a fungi growing at her weekend manor, and was able to derive a cure. Immediately after, she was hired as the physician extraordinaire for all Akals of Avamezan since."

The gnolls of Zokka's pack were even worse - those even suspected to be capable of magic were taken away, assuredly to be sacrificed in fiendish rituals.\n\nThough Hašr was never the most strict about enforcing the elven mandate, all of it came to change once the Jadd liberated us from the gnolls. Finally, those humans with magical talent were able to practice their craft openly, and our humble lands quickly became a home for those with magical capabilities. Originally taught by converted elves, magical tutelage was soon formalized and mages trained within Hašr have been responsible for winning countless battles for the light of the Jadd."

The leader of this resistance was an individual named Marodeen szal-Akur, known as the "Hašr Hawk", and he was - and still is - one of the most popular figures in the area. Upon hearing of Zokka's death, they mobilized the entire country for a rising against the gnolls and what seemed to be the invading elves.\n\nCalmer minds prevailed, and the Hašr Hawk was eventually coaxed into requesting an audience with Jaddar himself. He came away from this meeting a fervent follower of the Jadd, and the endorsement of the Hawk was enough to bring much of the country over to feel similarly. His legacy might be seen even today, for the Hašr are some of Surael's most unconditional followers."

This rule found itself unenforced under the chains of the Devourer-of-Suns, for the simple survival of any with elven blood was enough of an accomplishment to spill any of it, diluted or otherwise. Though born of necessity, this tolerance became deliberate under the Jadd, and the mingling of races seen as just another piece of the plan for them all.\n\nThis tolerance did not go unnoticed by the inhabitants of the akalates - an exodus to Hašr was far more appealing, and far easier, for any refugee half-elves than any other. The cultural and intellectual skillbase of these high-elves allowed Hašr to flourish. Even now, we are able to draw more advisors from those who others have shunned."

It is said that Zokka Devourer-of-Darkness could not convince a regiment from Hašr to follow him until he had farmed lentils for over a year, and could coax their riches out of the soil as naturally as any farmer.\n\nThough many in the Empire would hesitate to use force to subjugate the wicked, the denizens of Hašr have no such qualms.

Exploration of this chamber discovered faded magical relics and, more importantly, a series of spell tablets. Divination-dated to shortly after Jaher's conquest of Far Bulwar, these spell tablets appeared to be the buried research of a figure whose name could not be found.\n\nRegardless of who they were, their genius was unprecedented - the spells within this shrine were all of destructive power, in ways never even considered otherwise.

Instead, they largely govern themselves according to the teachings of Mula Swift-Sparrow, prophetess and granddaughter of the legendary Siaduna Flaming-Talon. Mula's teachings, which focused on cooperation, persuasion, and diplomacy were long derided as a weak philosophy of an impractical dreamer, but the sky queens of distant Mulen do not see it this way.

These two groups rarely fight with each other, but when such conflicts do occur it is the harpies of Mulen who war with the plains-dwellers and drive them back across the pass.\n\nTheir centuries of fighting against centaurs, swift and powerful warriors who could kill with one firm blow, have led to the warriors of Mulen favoring evasive and defensive techniques.

Even the desert elves, who laid ancient Siadanlen low, have lessons to teach, for they espouse a message of tolerance and coexistence not unlike that of Mula Swift-Sparrow.\n\nThough we may not be trusted for the reputation our foremothers have built for us, the lure of these lessons is great. When we descend upon the caravans of the Golden Highway, the traders expect us to come as raiders, but we must be more than bandits if we are to grow as a people despite our isolation.

Though trade would at first be tentative and trust slow to come, the harpies of Mulen would prove to be willing traders and adept merchants, their descent upon merchant caravans not a sign of ill omen but instead good fortune and glad tidings, exchanging raw gems for worked materials and slaves to mine gems in cramped spaces that the harpies could not navigate. More and more, by the early 17th century AA, the sight of harpies winging their way across the skies of the Far Salahad was a sign of good fortune instead of ill, and though many still distrusted them, the appearance of the winged traders was a well documented phenomenon that few ignored."

Sculpted of brick and stone, the cities were oriented for harpy travel, and featured unique architecture that allowed walking as well as easy arrival and departure via flight, and the cities were planned with three-dimensional movement in mind. Beyond just the breathtaking vistas and vertigo-inducing drops, the hanging cities of Mulen featured baths, gardens, libraries, and great markets, and many a merchant made treks to these remote isolated towns, as much for the lure of the riches they contained as the experience of having witnessed the wonder of the Siadunan Sky-Cities."

Shattered by Jaher's onslaught, the roosts fell one by one, and countless sisters were killed by the self-proclaimed Sun God. But the years have been long since the Phoenix Emperor cast down the Queendom, and the elves are weak and off-balance from decades of infighting.

Those who fell under her rule found the Ivoryfeather to be far from a sadistic tyrant, however - and all those who were willing to regularly pay their tithes of finished goods or specialty knowledge were dealt with fairly under her Queendom. \n\nIt was during the days of the Ivoryfeather that the greatest symbol of the Siadunian Harpies was crafted - the Crest of Ishtara, a magnificent crown of gold, gemstones, and the queen's own feathers, a diadem as radiant as the rising sun, crafted by a dozen captive dwarven artisans and tempered with the blood of defeated harimari warriors.

The penetrating power of the arquebus, meanwhile, allowed the harpies to circumvent the weakness of their shortbows if the problems of long-range accuracy on these early muskets could be overcome. Always militaristic and willing to adopt new tactics, the Siadunan harpies experimented with arquebuses captured in their raids along the golden highway and began to modify their formation flying for firearm tactics in the later 16th century. Young harpies of Siaden would be trained in gunpowder warfare starting at a early age to familiarize themselves with using such weapons on the wing or standing, and the great accuracy cultivated by these youths would be a boon to the Free Queens of Siadan in their long war of resistance against the Jaddari Desert Phoenixes. Delivering devastating volleys on the flanks of an enemy to demoralize or stagger a front line before plunging into the line with razor talons, the harpies of Siadan proved that the Mistresses of the Skies could and would remain formidable foes in the new age of powder warfare that was dawning on Halcann."

 I99_jazhobedin_desc:0 "While other nations may refer to the jazhobedin - our great cities - as "teeming" or perhaps "overrun", we see them as being the beating heart of our new united kingdom. No space will go to waste in the caverns, as an unending deluge of goblin settlers pour forth at the chance of even the smallest space.\n\nWhere a mine can be dug or a hut erected, it shall be, and we will reap the benefits of it. No more shall silence reign in the caverns; it shall be replaced by the ever growing din of goblin-kind."

 I99_courage_of_the_horde_desc:0 "Dwarves, hobgoblins, humans. All of them stand in their disciplined lines and stand bravely, armor shining. All of them fall before the might of the goblin horde, the war-chant flying ahead of the wave.\n\nEvery goblin knows that should they falter, they will fall, trampled under foot; but those who march forward, charge forward, roaring, chanting, riding the wave, will be buoyed by a horde!"
 I99_entry_to_the_kingdom:0 "The Rites of Loyalty"
 I99_entry_to_the_kingdom_desc:0 "Not so long ago, our tribes had traditions regarding loyalty and how one could show it. Imbibing certain mushrooms native to the undergrowth, the petitioner would be afflicted with horrendous visions. Should they survive, and afterwards swear an oath to the chief of the tribe, they would be granted a place within the tribe. With our recent conquest, it has been proposed that this rite be extended to some of our new subjects; should they survive, they could become useful additions to our kingdom."
 I99_the_slum_diggers:0 "Bringing Purpose to the Slums"
 I99_the_slum_diggers_desc:0 "On occasion, subjects residing in the jazhobedin might end up lacking as firm a purpose as the kingdom requires. With the ever growing pressures of international conflict, our most wise and benevolent rulers have come up with a way to fix this problem.\n\nGroups of particularly large, tough goblins and their helpers go through the slums where these poor neglected individuals are, and with encouraging words and forceful persuasion, make them realize what glory they may find in the hordes. Our reserves have never been so full!"
 I99_a_goblin_king:0 "A Goblin King"
 I99_a_goblin_king_desc:0 "Our people long ago used small, primitive trinkets - such as a stolen scepter, or a broken crown - to show the power of our chiefs. Now that we have taken the treasures of many other lands, and brought others to serve us, we shall make an icon of the power of our leader that will act as a beacon for our people. Whoever wears this Undercrown shall be known as the Goblin King, and all shall bow before them!"
 I99_whip:0 "Where There's a Whip There's a Way"
 I99_whip_desc:0 "To the east the Command uses brutal measures to ensure the servitude of their subjects. In the Underkingdom we do not reduce ourselves to such depravities, and know a whip is merely a tool, not a way of life. Of course we do use whips on our indentured servants, but that is for their own good and many are willing to pay for this service. Voluntarily of course."
 I99_copying_the_raj:0 "Copying the Raj"
 I99_copying_the_raj_desc:0 "With our rule over the goblins consolidated, we can finally look beyond internal squabblings. To the south, we see opportunities for trade — but more notably, have also encountered a sprawling administration that rules most the sub-continent and offers unity despite vast cultural, and even racial, differences. We should do our best to emulate their practices, though where they employ an elite bureaucracy, we must of course apply horde tactics. They've served us before, and will serve us just as well here!"

 Z42_legacy_of_the_bluetongues_desc:0 "The Elfrealm of Varivar was founded by Varilor Bluetongue, Munas Moonsinger's older brother, as a reward for him and the elves who served under him and and his brother during the War of the Sorcerer-King. While Varilor's long rule is remembered as a prosperous one, his longest-lasting legacy was in his treatment of humans who lived in eastern Damesear.\n\nWhen other Elfrealms maintained their elven purity - or intermingled to such an extent that they no longer were true Elfrealms - Varilor ensured that the Damerians were able to continue their separate existence under his lordship, leading to Varivar becoming unique among the Elfrealms of Cannor for retaining minority elven rule over a human majority. Interestingly, this led to Varivar becoming a haven for not only elves, but for all races, in spite of the apparent disproportionate rule."
 Z42_the_bluewood_arsenal:0 "The Bluewood Arsenal"
 Z42_the_bluewood_arsenal_desc:0 "During the War of the Sorcerer-King, Varilor Bluetongue had used Varivar's forests to rebuild Dameria's devastated navy, allowing the Free Leagues' navy to contest with the Castanorian Fleet's hegemony on Dameshead, and giving rise to Varivar as one of Dameria's primary shipyards.\n\nBy the time the Silmunas had become emperors of Anbennar, Varivar's booming shipbuilding industry was paving the way for an economic boom in the coming decades. The largest of these shipbuilders, the Bluewood Arsenal, became famous for producing some of the finest ships in the Dameshead, the vast majority of which went to supply Dameria's 'Wooden Wall'."
 Z42_cult_of_the_moonsinger:0 "Cult of the Moonsinger"
 Z42_cult_of_the_moonsinger_desc:0 "Since Munas' deification in 1022, he has been the most popular deity in Varivar, in part due to the Bluetongues sparing no expense when his cult was established, and since he was the most relevant deity for Varivarians' livelihoods, being the god most associated with sailing. The fact that many of Varivar's elves had personally known Munas in life and held great respect for him also played a role, of course.\n\nFor almost five centuries, the Temple of Munas at Varivar remained the center of the Moonsinger's veneration, being eclipsed in importance by the Great Temple of Ibevar only after the temple's sacking by the Wexonards in the aftermath of Dameria's dismantlement. Even after Varivar's conversion to Ravelianism, Munas' worship continued on, with the 16th day of Esmarment being an annual holiday to mourn Munas' death and celebrate his life."
 Z42_stronghold_of_silmunism:0 "Stronghold of Silmunism"
 Z42_stronghold_of_silmunism_desc:0 "Varivar's prosperity and economic growth during the reign of the Silmuna ensured that its people were one of the Silmunas' most loyal supporters, which contributed to the Varivarians being the last members of the Moon Party to lay down their arms after Adenn Skylance's last stand in Anbenncóst.\n\nVarivarian loyalty persisted even after their annexation and Dameria's dissolution in the aftermath of the Fourth Lilac War. The Varivarians spearheaded a Silmunist movement among Dameria's former subjects that seeked to restore Silmuna rule over Dameria's former lands. Wexonard attempts at curtailing the Silmunist movement through violence simply pushed the loyalists underground, giving rise to the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."

 Z42_seaforts_of_damesear_crossing_desc:0 "While the seaside fortifications in the county of Eargate tend to be overlooked due to Acromton's fame as the 'Crossguard', they are no less important for Damesear's security. Since Eargate has traditionally served as the Damesear's first line of defence in the east, the fort of Eargate has throughout the years been upgraded to stay up to date with advancing technology and hosted a small order of battlemages that provided the fortifications with much-needed firepower prior to the age of gunpowder. However, as naval batteries grew more advanced, the seafort on the tiny island of Floodtower Pass grew more important, since it had the ability to intercept any vessel trying to cross the sea to Damesear.\n\nThese fortifications proved crucial during the Corinite Wars, where the water batteries and the battlemages of the seaforts stopped the Corinite League's navies' advance to Damesear, and would have posed a significant obstacle for Camir's invasion of Anbennar, were it not for the sabotage of the fortifications by the Shadowmoon Conspiracy."
 Z42_marines_of_varivar:0 "Marines of Varivar"
 Z42_marines_of_varivar_desc:0 "Varivar's dependence on the sea for its income and trade connections left it particularly vulnerable to raids by the various warlord states that emerged during the Interregnum. In response, Varilor's successor, Erondil Bluetongue, established a dedicated naval infantry company in 1207 to protect Damesear's coasts and merchant fleet from foreign incursions. First of its kind in the world, Varivar's Marín Company would go on to become the blueprint after which the other marine corps of Cannor were modeled, and even named after.\n\nIn the aftermath of Varivar's annexation, the unemployed marines entered the services of foreign fleets as naval officers and drill sergeants, or formed freelance mercenary companies, such as Laochri síl na Már or the Dameshead Marine Company. From the first landings of Lorentish forces in Noruin, to the Gnomish Hierarchy's invasion of Eordand, these 'free marines' would be vital to the success of countless amphibious assaults, and would eventually form the basis of Anbennar's Imperial Marine Corps."
 Z42_sustainable_development_act:0 "Sustainable Development Act"
 Z42_sustainable_development_act_desc:0 "As artificery gave rise to industrialisation, Varivar came to struggle with questions of the impacts on nature of industrialisation and urbanisation. On one hand, Varivarians valued their forests and did not want to see them being destroyed by these rampant developments. On the other hand, Varivar's earlier proto-industrialisation had made the region wealthy by Imperial standards, with windmills, shipbuilding, and clothmaking generating an export economy that rivaled those of much larger duchies.\n\nVarivar took a third path, spearheaded by economist and former forester Aveline síl Marionaire: sustainable development. Based on the forest management laws of 1654, which combated the overexploitation of forests for timber with mandatory forest replantings and logging regulations, Aveline proposed an economic policy organising Varivar's economy to ensure that living conditions and the economy's needs were met without undermining the stability of nature. Although the Sustainable Development Act was implemented only at a local level, it nonetheless led to Varivar being the sole voice of sustainable design in the Empire against the chorus of maximised industrialisation, and led to Varivar becoming the center of nature conservation and environmentalist movements in Cannor."

After many years of skirmishing and yet no decisive results King Rylen Adshaw of Adshaw grew impatient, and Coldmarket saw opportunity. Conspiring with Celmaldor we presented an opportunity too good for the Rylen Adshaw to resist - word reached him of a meeting of the rebel leaders in Coldmarket - and prepared Coldmarket's surroundings. The Adshawman army was defeated and King Rylen was slain, marking the end of Adshaw dominance over the Reach.\n\nTo this day Coldmarket stands ready to oppose any would be kings of the Reach, and remind them of the fate that befell Adshaw."

Altought this has given our traders a reputation as stubborn it has increased their profits significantly."
 Z29_finest_of_furs:0 "Finest of Furs"
 Z29_finest_of_furs_desc:0 "While their majesty doesn't compare to the exquisite garbs created by Celmaldorian elves, the furs of Coldmarket are widely regarded as the finest in all of the Reach, while also being far more practical than traditional elven clothing due to the region's cold climate. With the depletion of the Cannorian Beaver driving up the price of furs, they became a steady source of income for Coldmarket."
 Z29_thednkerkja:0 "Thednkerkja"
 Z29_thednkerkja_desc:0 "Coldmarket boasts the largest Skaldhyrric population of all the cities of the Reach. In 1512 the then Mayor of Coldmarket, an Ulric Chapman, approved the expansion of the Thednkerkja, the Melt Church, which had originally been built in 502 upon what was said to built on the first lands to thaw after Elkaesal fell aslumber. The expanded temple itself was not finished until 1522 and it stood as the tallest Skaldhyrric temple south of the Giants Grave Sea since."

 Z99_sorcerer_king:0 "The Ascendant"
 Z99_sorcerer_king_desc:0 "In the cosmology of the Black Doctrine, all beings with the capability to use magic are positioned somewhere in a great chain of ascension, sometimes called the 'Ascendant Path'. At the near end of this path are the so-called 'potentiates', people who have latent magical ability but lack the discipline to use it in any consistent and meaningful way. At the far end lies the Universal Mind, the great dispassionate, impersonal intellect which suffuses all the world. The Ascendant is the being who traverses this great path, growing in each stage until they achieve a true union with that purest Intellect. Officially, every Sorcerer-King was Ascendant, though any serious discussion with heretics will reveal that this is a point of much contention."
 Z99_week_of_ascension:0 "The Week of Ascension"
 Z99_week_of_ascension_desc:0 "The Week of Ascension was simultaneously one of the world's most egalitarian institutions and one of its most stratified. Regardless of social class, all non-magical subjects participated in the same festivals and shared in the same activities during the seven-day celebration of virtue. However, every magic user was kept separate from these festivities, instead joining the Sorcerer-King in the Charred Tower for a week of celebration, debauchery, and furious politicking."
 Z99_unrestricted_magic:0 "Unrestricted Magic"
 Z99_unrestricted_magic_desc:0 "There have been various attempts to regulate and control magical research throughout the history of the mortal realms. Indeed, perhaps one of the truest signs of a healthy state has been its ability to impose at least some basic restrictions on the activities of mages. In the Black Demesne, to suggest such regulations was not merely seen as foolish, but rather a blasphemous heresy against Doctrine itself. Any law which restricted the development of Intellect was opposed to Doctrine, and restrictions on magic were the most heinous of these."
 Z99_in_the_eyes_of_the_great:0 "In the Eyes of the Great"
 Z99_in_the_eyes_of_the_great_desc:0 "Though the non-magical classes could not ascend to the highest rungs of state power in the Demesne, and though they had very limited rights, they nonetheless rose in prominence. Precisely because the most powerful positions were restricted to magic users, these same powerful people often chose to surround themselves with those who could not possibly be a threat. They often promoted members of the non-magical class based on pure competence, justifying the high placement on the basis of intellectual virtue. This was in stark contrast to many other kingdoms, where promotion was by right of blood alone."
 Z99_the_shadows_flux:0 "The Reaper's Gift"
 Z99_the_shadows_flux_desc:0 "Undead are useful on the field of battle as brute soldiers, but they have very limited capacity to think for themselves or listen to verbal orders. Thus, the Demesne had great need for living scouts, battlefield engineers, and officers. Such positions were an excellent way for non-magical subjects to climb the social ladder by making themselves valuable to mages. Every time war was declared, a great influx of some of the Demesne's most intelligent, driven, and ambitious people came to serve the army in all manner of roles, a pattern that would later earn the moniker of 'the Reaper's Gift'."
 Z99_reformulated_organization:0 "Reformulated Organization"
 Z99_reformulated_organization_desc:0 "In most societies, mages are typically reclusive academics who have little interest in battlefield glory, and only a smaller portion have the inclination to take up arms and lend their talents to the field of glory. In the Demesne, it was an expectation and personal obligation for every magical initiate to serve for at least some time in the military. This vastly greater pool of magical manpower allowed the Demesne to turn the entire upper officer corps into the exclusive province of mages, allowing decentralized and responsive magical tactics that were far more impressive than any single sorcerer could achieve alone." 
 Z99_the_eighth:0 "Rings of the Eight"
 Z99_the_eighth_desc:0 "At its greatest extent, the Black Demesne had eight Acolytes, each of whom wore an ebony ring, numbered from the First to the Eighth in order of magical prowess and prominence within the court. The Sorcerer-King wore a matching ring of dark gold, signifying dominance, which would become known as the Eighth ring. Theoretically, as long as one wore the ring of an Acolyte, one was honorbound to give nothing but absolute loyalty to the legitimate bearer of the Eighth ring in all matters. This reminder of hierarchy and control fortified the political order of the Demesne's upper class."

An Acolyte was expected to master every discipline of the mind in the course of honing their Intuition, including both magical pursuits and the more traditional contents of an aristocratic education. This generalized intellectual prowess gave them the ability to draw on vastly disparate domains of knowledge and see connections where others could not."

 acolytes_scheming_of_the_simulacrum_desc:0 "The Week of Ascension was a festival which occurred every five years to mark the first Ascension of the original Sorcerer-King, Nichmer. During this time, every member of the magical class, including the Acolytes, would be summoned to the Charred Tower. This was the focal point of each Acolyte's political machinations, using the opportunity to form alliances, isolate rivals, and build relationships with promising initiates who could become personal aides."
 acolytes_unrestricted_magic:0 "Unrestricted Magic"
 acolytes_unrestricted_magic_desc:0 "While restrictions on magic were anathema in the Demesne, each Acolyte often had personal research projects and areas of interest. Through a combination of implicit demands and explicit incentives, Acolytes could direct the flow of magical research among their immediate subordinates, often achieving great breakthroughs on the back of accumulated knowledge and a total lack of ethical barriers. Such breakthroughs could then be kept secret, to be used at the most opportune time for the Acolyte's personal benefit."
 acolytes_in_the_eyes_of_the_great:0 "In the Eyes of the Great"
 acolytes_in_the_eyes_of_the_great_desc:0 "The Acolytes of the Demense were expected to retain a formal staff of talented initiates, their own magical apprentices, to handle the most pressing matters of governance. While this staff would indeed make big picture decisions, the matters of daily governance were often tedious and held little interest for the magical classes. As a result, even these initiates conferred much of the day-to-day administration in the hands of trusted, non-magical secretaries and operatives."
 acolytes_the_shadows_flux:0 "The Reaper's Gift"
 acolytes_the_shadows_flux_desc:0 "The goal of each Acolyte below the Eighth was to ascend in rank, and goal of the Eighth was to maintain their position at all costs. The best time to jockey for status and the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favor was during times of war, where Acolytes would often command large contingents of the Demesne's forces and be responsible for a number of initiate officers. This meritocratic environment led to each Acolyte doing their best to acquire the most competent general staff from among the thousands of aspiring mundanes who rushed to the army each year as part of the great influx of talent known as the 'Reaper's Gift'."
 acolytes_reformulated_organization:0 "Reformulated Organization"
 acolytes_reformulated_organization_desc:0 "For the Acolytes, the organization of magical ranks stood in stark contrast to the meritocratic environment of the mundane staff. Often, positions were given to initiates solely on the basis of personal relationships or alliances, as the Acolytes attempted to strengthen the position of their various assets and pawns. This allowed the Acolytes to command a vast, informal power base among a chosen group of initiates, forging an officer corps that was deeply loyal to the Acolyte personally and which sought to perform to their greatest ability in return for the Acolyte's favor."
 acolytes_the_eight:0 "Rings of the Eight"
 acolytes_the_eight_desc:0 "The formal ordering of the Eight Rings was a tool used by the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle] to reward competence and bestow personal favor. Though each ring was explicitly about a contract of loyalty, to the Acolytes they also carried an implicit promise of meritocracy and fair play on the part of the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle]. Over time, the rituals surrounding the rings and the personal relationship between each Acolyte and the [Z99.Monarch.GetTitle] would take on greater layers of meaning, with their formal interactions becoming a dense maze of metaphor and meaning only decipherable by a select few at the heart of the court."
